            <p>
            These Supreme Court predictions are made using machine learning
            software that has examined hundreds of past cases and learned what
            to look for to make a successful prediction.
            </p>
            <p>
            It takes several steps to arrive at a prediction for a case. First,
            the software goes to the Supreme Court&rsquo;s website and downloads
            a transcript of the oral arguments. It then parses the transcript 
            file to extract key information, like the case number, date the case
            was argued, and the names of the parties to the case.  The software
            also goes through the text of the transcript itself and collects 
            information, such as how many times each lawyer was interrupted, or
            how many words the justices spoke.
            </p>
            <p>
            Then the algorithm evaluates the case on a number of criteria: was
            the lawyer for the petitioners interrupted more than once every 71
            words? Was there more than one lawyer for the respondents? Were
            there eight justices or nine? The algorithm has learned the  exact
            values to check for each of these criteria by looking at past
            cases.  It also knows how each criteria affects the overall chances
            of success for the petitioner.  For example, the petitioner has won
            only 1.7% of cases where their lawyer was interrupted more than
            once every 71 words on average. The algorithm then combines all of
            this information into a final estimate of the chances for each side
            of winning the case.
            </p>
            <p>
            The technical name for this kind of prediction algorithm is a 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_classifier" target="_blank">Naive Bayes Classifier</a>.
            Because of some of the assumptions that are made by the model, the
            probabilities that it estimates for each side are very rough and
            imprecise.  Other than giving some sense of the confidence of the
            algorithm, there's not much difference between a 56% chance and a
            92% one. 
            </p>
            <p>
            The model trains itself by looking at some past cases, while it
            leaves others for later so it can try to predict them without
            having seen them before.  That way, it&rsquo;s possible to get a
            clear sense of the model&rsquo;s accuracy.  Predicting over 750
            cases, the model was correct 75% of the time.
