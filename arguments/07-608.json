The people who commit a crime of domestic violence. Now what's that? In the statute he says it is a misdemeanor crime of violence committed by a person in a family relation with the victim. Then he says after, I changed that language a little. I'll tell you why. Because somebody told me misdemeanor crime of violence is too broad. It could include cutting up a credit card. So I'll define it more specifically. And he defines if more specifically to say that it is a crime that has as an element the use or attempted use of physical force or threatening people with a weapon. End of the matter. They substitute those words and they did another thing the drafter as he breaks out the thing it says: It is a crime that is a misdemeanor and, you see, and that's where the problem is, because if you put in a \"that,\" then you have to have an \"is.\" So he left out the \"is.\" Okay. So I say what did Senator Lautenberg want with these words? I see. How did he change it? I see. I can't find a word that supports the reason that you have. Now, maybe they are there. That's what you'll tell me. And then I say it's the fine language consistent with what he wanted. It requires putting in an \"is.\" I don't find that too awful. Okay.
