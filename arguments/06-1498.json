You came up and began and said this drug has side effects that hurt people. And that's a risk when you have a drug, and it's a terrible thing if the drug hurts people. There's a risk on the other side. There are people who are dying or seriously sick, and if you don't get the drug to them they die. So there's a problem. You've got to get drugs to people and at the same time the drug can't hurt them. Now, who would you rather have make the decision as to whether this drug is, on balance, going to save people or, on balance, going to hurt people? An expert agency, on the one hand, or 12 people pulled randomly for a jury role who see before them only the people whom the drug hurt and don't see those who need the drug to cure them? Now, that it seems to me is Congress's fundamental choice, and Congress has opted for the agency.

In this case, the drug has already been withdrawn. So I assume the FDA has at least a reduced incentive to go into these questions.

But if the drug was still out there, it seems to me you could come forward, and I would be much less sympathetic to what you're trying to do. You could trust the FDA to do the job."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":4,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"No, but once it sanctions the Plaintiff, the Government can't make the argument you are interfering; you are second-guessing the FDA.
