And so, I went back reading our cases, and Justice Story many, many years ago said, look, falsehoods have no value as such, but the \"breathing space\" concept is defined by those falsehoods which cause injury to rights that people possess, to pecuniary -- to pecuniary interests that they have, or to the reputation of others.  And almost every statute where we've approved a harm concept as being permissible for recovery has affected one of those three things.

Wouldn't take much to do exactly what Congress said it was doing, which was to protect against fraudulent claims of receiving a medal, and the example it used was someone who used a fraudulent claim of receiving a medal to get money. What I'm trying to get to is what harm are we protecting here?  I thought that the core of the First Amendment was to protect even against offensive speech.  We have a legion of cases that said your emotional reaction to offensive speech is not enough. If that is the core of our First Amendment, what I hear, and that's what I think the court below said, is you can't really believe that a war veteran thinks less of the medal that he or she received because someone's claiming fraudulently that they got one.  They don't think less of the medal.  We're reacting to the fact that we're offended by the thought that someone's claiming an honor they didn't receive. So, outside of the emotional reaction, where's the harm?  And I'm not minimizing it.
