My understanding, and correct me if I'm wrong on the facts, is that the exercises began in February of 2007.

So it sounds to me as though that, if there is an emergency, it's one that the Navy created simply by failing to start an EIS preparation in a timely way at which it tried in effect to sort of neutralize by keeping everybody in the dark until the last moment.

The first was that the Navy had affidavits which says -- they say -- I read them. Maybe I just missed the contrary. But they said that: You are requiring us, judge, to turn the sonar down to six decibels or up to six, whatever, whenever we had to run into a situation called layering of different temperature levels. And we tell you, as naval officers, that that's just where submarines like to hide. And we also tell you that if we can't train people to do that they will miss out on an important part of how to find these submarines. I saw no answer to that. The second thing they said was that: We're willing to turn off the sonar if there's any marine mammal that comes within 500 yards, which is a quarter of a mile, about. But you insist that we turn off the sonar when any animal comes within a mile and a quarter. And that's quite a big distance more. A lot of animals come in there, and if we have to turn off the sonar all those times, we are not going to be able to get much training done. Now, those two things seem to be quite important. And I just might have missed, which I might have, which is why I'm asking, what the response was by equivalent experts to those points."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":7,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"What do you mean, despite the complete absence?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":7,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"That's the whole point.

So obviously they couldn't have training."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":7,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Now, what they are saying is, when you do run into that situation you've got to train people to deal with it.

How could they have?"},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Well, with one important qualification. The question was the balance of those equities on a preliminary basis.

Not even after we have decided they were wrong, just because we think there is a likelihood that they might be wrong."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Well, I thought that would have been the whole ball game until I read your brief. Your brief does not spend a page defending the decision on the merits of the lower courts. Nothing about emergency circumstances or CEQ.

And I see on the other side a district judge who just says, you're wrong, I then have to look to see what the basis is, because I know that district judge doesn't know about it, either. So, the basis so far I'm thinking on this one is zero.
