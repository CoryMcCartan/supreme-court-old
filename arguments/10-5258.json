United States. Mr. Gordon.

So a maximum of 10 years is prescribed for Mr. McNeill, and all others who committed the offense prior to the change in law.  So it is -- it is the State's current position that for this offense the maximum is 10 years."},{"name":"JUSTICE ALITO","id":5,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Suppose -- what would happen in this situation?  A defendant is convicted under a State statute that says that anybody who sells between 1 ounces -- 1 ounce and 5 ounces of a particular controlled substance is guilty of a felony and may be punished by imprisonment for a certain amount of time. And then the State repeals that provision altogether and enacts a new provision that says anybody who sells between 1 ounces -- 1 ounce and 8 ounces is punishable by a certain penalty.  And now the question comes up what -- what penalty does the court look at with respect to the earlier offense that no longer exists for which the defendant was convicted?"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Mis --"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Mr. Gordon, is this -- is this essentially an academic question?  Because this district judge said that he would impose the same sentence as a variant even if he couldn't do it under the guidelines, even if it were an incorrect calculation.  He said:  This criminal record is violent and astonishing; essentially, I'm going to throw the book at him, and I'm going to do it through a variant if that's no -- if there's no other way. So isn't that -- I mean, isn't this an -- an exercise, essentially an academic exercise, if -- if your -- your client would end up in the same place?"},{"name":"JUSTICE KAGAN","id":6,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Mr. Gordon, there are other provisions in ACCA which seem to use the present tense in circumstances where it doesn't seem as though the statute truly means the present tense.  So, a violent felony is one that \"has as an element the use of physical force, is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives;\" and so on and so forth. But we would not look as to -- in interpreting that provision to the present day, would we?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":7,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Why is -- why is -- why is the present tense inadequate for the -- for the government's position in this case?

Why is -- I don't see why your argument requires us to ask what would be the term if he had committed the offense at a later date.  The maximum term for his offense when he committed it is those years because the State did not retroactively reduce his sentence."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":7,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"It's not just for the defendant; it's for anybody who committed it prior to the -- prior to the amendment of the statute."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":7,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Anybody that committed it then, the -- the -- it is an offense \"involving manufacturing, distributing, or possessing with intent to manufacture or distribute a controlled...for which a maximum term of imprisonment of 10 years or more is prescribed by law.\"  It is prescribed by law for any of those offenses that occurred between whenever that old statute was enacted and whenever this statute was enacted."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"What if the State --"},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"What if the State change is to abolish the offense altogether?

That's --"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":7,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"That's correct?  You're happy with that?  The person committed a felony when it was a felony, and the State later no longer makes it a felony, and it isn't counted for purposes of the Armed Career Criminal Act?"},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Well, but it strikes me that there's really no change in the State view of how serious it is.  It was just an overall change in how they're going to look at sentencing.  Under the prior regime, you're sentenced to a particular term, but in fact you serve a lot less.  With the new treatment in sentencing, you're sentenced to what is a much -- a smaller term, but you in fact are going to serve the whole thing.  At the end of the day, there's no real change in how they view the seriousness of the offense."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":7,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Are we looking at it because we want the States to determine the Federal sentence or are we looking at it because we evaluate the evil of the particular defendant on the basis of how -- how much of a crime he was willing to commit? And so long as it was a serious felony when he committed it, this is a bad actor.  I don't care if the State changes its view.  At the time, he was willing to commit a felony that put him in jail for 10 years, and that's what we're looking to, it seems to me, how bad an apple is this fellow that -- that we're talking about putting away?  And that doesn't change simply because the State decides in the future that that same act will not be a felony.  Well, people who perform that act in the future aren't so bad; they're just -- you know, just normal not-so-good people -- (Laughter.)"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":7,"spokeBefore":7,"sideBefore":"justices","text":"-- but they're not the kind of a person who's willing to -- to commit a felony that, you know, puts them away for 10 years. It seems to me that that's what the Federal law is looking to.  We're not giving over to the States the decision of -- of how long we should incarcerate somebody in a Federal prison."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":7,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"I agree, it does refer to the seriousness of the offense.  But it refers to the seriousness of the offense at the time the offense was committed in order to determine how bad a fellow this is, not -- not because we want the States to determine how long we're going to keep Federal prisoners in prison."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":7,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"That's the issue, though, really."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":7,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"But you'll -- you'll put away for a long time somebody who really wasn't that bad a guy.  He committed a misdemeanor, and when the State later makes it a felony, you -- he suddenly comes under ACCA.  And I -- I can't believe that that's -- that's what -- what Congress had in mind just because the State now thinks that it's more serious.  Who cares what the State thinks?  We -- we want to know how bad an actor this particular defendant is."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"I'm -- I'm not sure what you're urging now.  Are -- are you modifying or retracting the answer you gave to Justice Sotomayor, that is, the case where the maximum was 5 years, but then at the time of the Federal offense the State has changed it so it's 10 years? I -- I think you answered her question that it would work the same way, that what mattered is how the State currently ranks the offense, not the offender. But now you seem to be saying there might be a different answer when the State increases rather than decreases the penalty."},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":8,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"In -- in the hypothetical where the penalty is increased, would there be an ex post facto problem?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"I'm sorry, how do you see that?  I thought the government had two alternative positions, the first being that you look at the time -- at the time of the offense, at the conviction or, alternatively, it was arguing the way to take the position of the court below.  But if you're going to use the present tense then you look retroactively to see -- then you look to see whether the State would retroactively apply the new sentence."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"You understood their brief differently?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"I'm sure they'll tell you.

If there's been a modification of law that would have entitled him to a retroactive change in his sentence, although I'm not quite sure how that works, because if there's a modification, I thought it would only apply to a defendant who had committed the crime at that earlier time but was convicted at the present time.  This defendant wouldn't have his sentence modified."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":3,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Well, that's my question.
