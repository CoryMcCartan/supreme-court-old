Say it was the losing party, you know, that was asking the Federal judge, Judge, you have this case on your docket. Let's move it up.  Let's decide it now.  He doesn't use the word review, but everything else is the same.  He wants a decision out of that court that is going to be the opposite of what the State court did.

We didn't want the Federal court to review the State court.  We wanted our Federal court suit as an insurance policy in case something goes wrong with the State court suit.

Why would you want to mix those two things up that now seem to me rather clear, that if you have Rooker-Feldman, when you rush into a Federal court and say, Federal court, undo that State court judgment, I don't like it?  Rooker was just a paradigm case of that.  Why would you want to spread that doctrine?  What is -- what is there that preclusion doctrine doesn't accomplish?"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":4,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Well, I'm not talking about anything fancy like Colorado River.  Prior action pending is a familiar defense.  You've got two actions.  They could even be in different districts of the same State and one says, Your Honor, this case started second, the other one is going forward, hold it abeyance because there's a Page 25 prior action pending.  That's not Colorado River abstention or anything like that."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":4,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Well, sometimes district judges rule incorrectly, but -- but what happened here is the district court case did not go on because the two of you, both sides, said, okay, the district court -- they're all bollixed up with this Foreign Sovereign Immunity Act, so we're going to agree.  You agreed that the case would go forward in Delaware, the trial in Delaware.  Is that not so?"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":4,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Well, when you say they pushed in Delaware, you brought them into Delaware and a -- in a reverse suit.

I -- I mean, she wasn't answering my question, but she did say what was a perfectly satisfactory approach, that -- that the second person says, you know, Judge, there's another one pending and the judge says, okay, we'll let that go first except in some unusual instance."},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":7,"spokeBefore":8,"sideBefore":"justices","text":"Which happens thousands of times in -- in all of the courts.  It's very common and I don't know why we're over-designing this vehicle.  It's simply other action pending.

(Laughter.)"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":8,"spokeBefore":7,"sideBefore":"justices","text":"So why isn't it that the end? Page 28 I mean, here it's not moot.  They filed the other action. You point out that you not only think something could wreck the State claim, you would love it to wreck the State claim.

It is claim-precluded.  That's what preclusion doctrine is supposed to do.  So in that context, maybe this Court used the wrong word.  Maybe it should have said, you litigated it, it's over and done with, now it's precluded.  Why do you need to interject the word review? Isn't that -- unless you're going to say every time court A decides a case and then you're in court B and someone is raising the same claim, that is a review of court number one rather than you're precluded in court two because of what is -- has been litigated and decided in court one."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":4,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"It is sometimes."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":4,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"That's why one has preclusion because you are giving respect, full faith and credit, to a decision elsewhere.  That's what preclusion doctrine is all about.  We respect the judgment of the court that rendered it.  We, therefore, give it full faith and credit.  That's what preclusion doctrine is about, is about respect and credit.  Isn't that so?"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":4,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"But you -- Page 31"},{"name":"JUSTICE O'CONNOR","id":3,"spokeBefore":4,"sideBefore":"justices","text":"So some of the lower courts have given a broad interpretation to Rooker-Feldman and have turned it into something other than the narrower view of it.

The Third Circuit applies a rather broad interpretation of it."},{"name":"JUSTICE O'CONNOR","id":3,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"But maybe that isn't a proper application of Rooker-Feldman where the complaint is not about something the State court has improperly done."},{"name":"JUSTICE O'CONNOR","id":3,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"It isn't.  And so in that sense, the Third Circuit has a rather broader view of it I'd say."},{"name":"JUSTICE STEVENS","id":2,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Of course, that's the language that was used in both Rooker and Feldman too I think."},{"name":"JUSTICE STEVENS","id":2,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"And that's the only fact pattern any of our cases have dealt with."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":5,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"And the -- and the concern is I think -- at least as I understand the -- the concern with it, it -- it boils down to something like this. Somebody comes along and says, don't apply claim preclusion. Don't apply it because, for whatever reason, there's this -- Page 33 there's something wrong here, and -- and Federal court should determine the -- in fact, the -- the claim preclusion of the State judgment should not apply.  The answer to that is, look, that's an issue to be raised by way of appeal of your State judgment.  You don't appeal State judgments in Federal court.  Out. There's no such claim being made here.  The only claim that's being made here or the only conceivable claim, I guess, that can be made here is that we might want to do some litigating in the Federal case after the State case is over.  There's no claim here that claim preclusion should not apply in that instance, and because there's no such argument that claim preclusion does not apply, the answer to the problem that you're worried about is simply claim preclusion doctrine.  There's no reason to add a perihelion or something onto Rooker-Feldman to deal with what is really a very simple problem and that is, if they try to relitigate anew in Federal court, as Justice Ginsburg says, you -- you plead claim preclusion.  Simple. Why do we need to complicate it beyond that simplicity?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":5,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Well, no, because the -- it -- it would not rule out the need to have some answer when someone in a Federal court comes along and says, don't apply claim preclusion, whatever the reason may be.  Don't apply the claim preclusion rules.  There's something unfair about doing it here.  The answer to that is, look, what you're really asking us to do, when you say don't apply claim preclusion, is to review what happened in the State court, and we don't sit as an appellate court on State courts.  So there's still something for Rooker- Feldman to do on, as it were, Justice -- Justice Ginsburg's claim preclusion argument."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":5,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"It'll get the -- it'll get the Page 35 job done that you say will need to be done if you get to that point."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":5,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Why won't it?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":5,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Then -- then you --"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":5,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Then -- then you appeal.

All you have to do is move to dismiss because of a prior adjudication that has resolved this question. Do you know of any case in which the existence of a prior judgment in another court has been held to render a suit that someone wants to press to get a second judgment moot?

And you started out by saying this case, I think as you must, was a proper Federal case.  It was properly filed in -- and it was properly filed in Delaware.  So you can't talk about a case that says, if you've got this kind of case, you go in this door.  If that kind of case, you go in that door.  You have a case here that could go in either door, the Federal, the State. The usual rule is, is it not, that if Federal jurisdiction attaches, it doesn't get lost because of subsequent events.  For example, if a defendant moves into the plaintiff's State and the only basis for Federal Page 42 jurisdiction is diversity, subject matter jurisdiction isn't lost, is it?"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":4,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Maybe.
