In other words, you're trying to make the case here that there is something extremely unusual about this.  And I thought your answer to Justice Scalia in effect was one reason that it's unusual is that we don't have any of these cases in, in which a State court has knocked out a State law that is then subject to some kind of preclearance review.  And my only point was, if I understand the situation, as long as the preclearance review had not preceded the State constitutionality judgment, following the State constitutionality judgment there would be no law to take to Washington, whether it be to -- to the Justice Department or to -- or to the Court, and ask to have precleared.

In around July, Mr. Sam Jones is sworn in and now he is in office until sometime after, I guess, September 1988, a little over a year, and then the Governor appointed him.  Well, he must have gotten paid during that year."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":9,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"And then when the Governor appointed him, what does the appointment look like? Does it say it's retroactive?  No.  I would be surprised.  I mean, you're not going to tell me it is. So my guess is he's appointed as of -- let's say he's appointed by the Governor.  It must have said as of when, and it probably said as of September '88."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":9,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Well, I think it's important to me because, for this reason:  I would guess they don't make it retroactive or you'd know it, and therefore we -- we have more.  We have the facts, the following facts, as to whether -- and this is what Fordice says; it says this is a practical question. It's not some theory about whether it's unconstitutional or not unconstitutional.  The question is as practical matter was it in force and effect?  And, as a practical matter, one, there was an election under it; two, somebody was elected; three, he took office; four, he held that office for a year and was paid for it.  All right?  Why, as a practical fact, as a practical matter, we do not say that special election law was in force and effect for about a year and two months?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":9,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Yes, their registering is a precondition of voting.  Not one person had ever voted. Moreover, they all had to register again.  So the net practical effect of the election, of plan two in Young v. Fordice, was null, zero, zilch.  And the practical effect here is that somebody is elected under the law, holds office for a year and two months, and is paid.  It seems to me quite a big difference."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":9,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"All right.  I mean, that's what I wanted to know.  I mean, maybe it's different if this was a retroactive something or other, but I -- you're not aware of that."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":9,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"So I assume it wasn't."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":9,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Yes."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":9,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"All right.  Suppose I reject that on the ground of what I said.  I'm not saying I would, but suppose I did.  Isn't that the end of this case?  Because then, if I reject that, there is a plan.  The plan is called \"the special election plan.\" It is in effect for a year and two months.  People hold office in election and they're paid.  And then a new plan comes along, the governor's plan.  Now that seems to me a change, and the statute says that if you have a change, which this would be, you've got to preclear it. End of matter. Now, what's your argument about that?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":9,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"No, I'm just using that as shorthand, the shorthand for a system under which the officeholder is appointed by the government -- by the governor."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":9,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"And I'm saying if we start from the base that the plan is special election which was in force and effect for a year and two months, then for whatever set of reasons there is a change, and the State has to preclear the change.  Now, what's the answer to that?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":9,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"All right.  So you're saying that if the cause of a change is a court decision, then you do not have to preclear.  So that if in Mississippi in 1975, there had been a ruling of a court which said segregationist plan number one here is no good, so we're going to go back to the even worse plan that was before, that that wouldn't have had to have been precleared?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":9,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"You see where I'm going, and I'm not phrasing it correctly, but you can answer it anyway."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":6,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"It would have been able to be brought up here if it was based on a discriminatory intent, certainly."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":9,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"But what my question is, is there any authority for the proposition that between 1964 and today, it mattered whether the cause of a change in a State plan was a decision of let's say five members of a court -- of a State court -- or whether it was a legislative decision.  Because that's what I think you're arguing, and is there any authority that supports you on that?"},{"name":"JUSTICE ALITO","id":10,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Well, they argue in their brief that there were instances in which State supreme courts participated prior to the enactment of the Voting Rights Act in changes in election requirements for the purposes of disenfranchising African-Americans.  Are they wrong on that?  And if they're right on that, what reason is there to think that, without any text in section 5 to making an exception for changes that are made by State courts, what would be the reason for reading that in?"},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Now, counsel, since you mentioned section 5, perhaps you ought to look at it.  It says that you have to preclear standards, practices, whatever, different from that in force or effect on November 1st, 1964. Now, the Respondents in their brief accused you of making the argument that since this isn't different from what was in effect in 1964 you don't have to preclear it.  And you said, no, that's not what we're saying; we take no position on that. Why in the world did you say that?  It says quite clearly the standard has to be different from that in force or effect on November 1st, '64.  At that point these people were appointed."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Well, in your reply brief on page 8 you say you take no position on that question."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Well, there wouldn't be a different baseline for judicial changes than there would be for legislative or executive changes, would there?"},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":5,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Well, I take it it's your position -- and I noticed this in the question put to you by Justice Breyer -- tell me if this is wrong, but that it's not just the fact that the court makes a decision, because the court may have discretion to choose plan one, plan two, plan three, but it is if the court makes a decision to show that the prior practice was invalid, was void under State law."},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":5,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"That's the distinction, I take it."},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":5,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Not the fact that it's just the court, but the kind of decision the court makes."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":8,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Mr. Newsom, before you finish I would like to ask you a question about what action Governor Riley would take if you're right on the law?  That is, a mistake by the Alabama Circuit Court can't invalidate a law that the Supreme Court says on judicial review of -- on review of the circuit court, that the circuit court got it wrong. The first time around, when Jones was elected and then the Governor mooted any controversy by just appointing him.  Now we have a similar situation. We have somebody who has won an election overwhelmingly against the person that the Governor appointed.  There are, what, five months left in the term?  If your position on the law is correct, would the Governor in fact oust the person who was a four-to-one 1 winner in a popular election and install the person who was a loser in -- would that happen?  Could we project based on what happened the first time around that the Governor would not so thwart the will of the people?"},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Thank you, Mr. Newsom.

I didn't think you were arguing that because of the preclearance followed by the State determination of unconstitutionality, that the State was required to follow that unconstitution law.

Am I correct?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":6,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"For the reason that, absent their coming up with a new law, what law would be in effect?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":7,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"And isn't the answer that no law would be in effect?

The State at that point didn't have the old law because it had been repealed. It couldn't apply the new law because it wasn't precleared, and somebody in Alabama would have to do something.

They pass the legislation.  Three weeks go by.  The county council says:  You know, I made a mistake; that law was never passed; it was never signed by the governor.  What rule?

Because -- I mean, what they're saying is let's use a little common sense here.  And you look at Fordice and there it was an instance where it just didn't take effect at all as a practical matter. And then we cited those two cases you're talking about, but I can't tell from the Fordice opinion -- there was a ward system that was in fact in force or effect.  But I don't know how long that ward system was in effect.  It might have been for a long time, and people might have taken action under it. And the same thing is true in City of Lockhart.  I can't tell.  You may know.  But my point is they are saying:  Here we have a middle case, and what we want is to use enough sense to say, look, it wasn't really in effect.  People challenged it the minute they could.  They -- everybody knew it was unconstitutional, or a lot of people believed it.  And the Governor then did something to make up for it. If you're going to say that that little bit counts as putting it in force and effect, you know what we're going to have?  We're going to have every municipality all over the country that doesn't always know what the rules are, and they pass something, and people challenge it immediately, it's obviously wrong, and they're stuck with it as a matter of Federal law.

That's your whole theory."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":9,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Well, Young versus Fordice, that's Young versus -- I mean, if it never went into force and effect, of course we don't reach questions like republican form of government or 1964 safe harbors and so forth.  And so I think it's an important matter. And as I read Fordice, we have over here an instance where nothing happened.  You know, some people registered and then immediately they were told the registration was no good.  So it wasn't in force and effect. When I looked at Perkins v. Matthews, that was not a case where the law was challenged immediately. Rather, what Justice Brennan said is that this has been in effect from 1962 to 1965 at least, and in 1965 they had an election under the ward system.  So even if it might have been unconstitutional or it was, it was still in effect for three years.  In the other case, City of Lockhart, Justice Powell says this statute has been in effect, we assume, from 1917 to 1973.  That's not exactly a fleeting matter.  So -- so here we have a case where they challenged it instantly, where it was litigated as fast as it possibly could be, where in fact, as Justice Ginsburg just said, a different decision of the circuit court would have led to the opposite of it never would have even had it.  So what harm does it do to the enforcement of the civil rights laws of the United States if the holding of this Court were, well, under these circumstances, where challenged immediately, et cetera, it never took force and effect?"},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Counsel, you talk about force and effect.
