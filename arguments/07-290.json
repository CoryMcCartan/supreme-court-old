If it is limited to State militias, why would they say \"the right of the people\"?  In other words, why wouldn't they say \"state militias have the right to keep arms\"?"},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"But if that's right, doesn't that cut against you?  If the militia included all the people, doesn't the preamble that you rely on not really restrict the right much at all?  It includes all the people."},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"One of the concerns, Mr. Dellinger, of the framers, was not to establish a practice of amending the Constitution and its important provisions, and it seems to me that there is an interpretation of the Second Amendment differing from that of the district court and in Miller and not advanced particularly in the red brief, but that conforms the two clauses and in effect delinks them. The first clause I submit can be read consistently with the purpose I've indicated of simply reaffirming the existence and the importance of the militia clause. Those were very important clauses.  As you've indicated, they're in Article I and Article II.  And so in effect the amendment says we reaffirm the right to have a militia, we've established it, but in addition, there is a right to bear arms.  Can you comment on that?"},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"And this makes, it does -- I think you're write right in the brief to say that the preface shouldn't be extraneous.  This means it's not extraneous.  The Constitution reaffirms the rights, reaffirm several principles:  The right of the people to peaceably assemble, the right to be secure in their homes, the Tenth Amendment reaffirms the rights, and this is simply a reaffirmation of the militia clause."},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Well the subject is \"arms\" in both clauses, as I've suggested is the common subject, and they're closely related."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":5,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"I don't see how there's any, any, any contradiction between reading the second clause as a -- as a personal guarantee and reading the first one as assuring the existence of a militia, not necessarily a State-managed militia because the militia that resisted the British was not State- managed.  But why isn't it perfectly plausible, indeed reasonable, to assume that since the framers knew that the way militias were destroyed by tyrants in the past was not by passing a law against militias, but by taking away the people's weapons -- that was the way militias were destroyed. The two clauses go together beautifully:  Since we need a militia, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed."},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Well, do you think the clause, the second clause, the operative clause, is related to something other than the militia?"},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"All right.

My question is, if that is correct and \"keep\" should be read as, in effect, an independent guarantee, then what is served by the phrase \"and bear\"? In other words, if the people can keep them and they have them there for use in the militia as well as to hunt deer, why do we -- why do we have to have a further reference in there to a right to bear as well as to keep arms?

That's why I say 80,000 to 100,000. In the District, I guess the number is somewhere around 200 to 300 dead; and maybe, if it's similar, 1,500 to 2,000 people wounded.  All right.
