But today's information has -- or today's registry and requirements have information that Federal law doesn't permit to be disclosed, like driver's license, credit card information.  I mean, Federal law says you can't disclose that information. So isn't there a difference?

You do a surveillance which is what police do for a lot of crimes.  And you watch people going in for two hours and leaving, and you keep a record of it.

If somebody says no, and there's a real basis for believing that the evidence is going to be altered or destroyed, you can seize it pending judicial review, or you can get an administrative warrant ex parte and conduct a surprise examination if you want to.
