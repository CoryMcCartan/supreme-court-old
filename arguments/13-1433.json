A standard which says when you do and when you don't have to state, let this person present evidence.  We don't say it.  But the State has found one.  The State of Louisiana has a standard, and I take it if that's a good enough standard, that's what we should follow. And that standard from State v. Williams says, we will give you a hearing, if you, Mr. Smith, provide objective factors that will put at issue -- put at issue, the fact of mental retardation.  If you will come forward with some evidence to put your mental condition at issue.  And so I guess, unless we think Louisiana can't use that standard, that that standard is good enough for Federal purposes.  And, therefore, the issue is did your client and you put forward some evidence to put your mental condition at issue. And as long as you came forward with some evidence, then unless we're prepared to write some new Alderson Reporting Company Federal standard for when you have to give a hearing and when not, that's the question. And you're saying, among other things, of course, Judges -- you're telling us -- of course we put forward some evidence. In fact, we think we put forward a lot more, and we would have put forward a lot more if the hearing hadn't been pre-Atkins.

And unless you can point to precedent that shows that it was clearly established that you had a right to funding, then your -- your inability to put in evidence via the funding is not to be considered.

What he wants is a hearing.  He doesn't want us -- he'd like it -- but he doesn't want -- we don't have to say whether this person is intellectually disabled or not.  He wants a hearing.  And there is nothing in Atkins that says what the standard is to give him a hearing.

Now, am I right or wrong?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":9,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"No.  No.  You're not answering my question.  Of course we defer to the State, and we defer to the State when it makes what judgment? The judgment you, Mr. Defendant, are not entitled to a hearing.

It seems to me that if what happened here was the right thing, the Federal court went back and said, did the State properly preclude this Petitioner from putting on or discovering evidence?  Did it improperly fail to hold a hearing?  And the court there said, by the -- the courts -- by any standard, there was some evidence -- certainly by the State standard, but even by a constitutional standard, there was some evidence of incompetency.  He was entitled to a hearing.  They didn't give it to him, so now I will give him the hearing, because this is Federal habeas.  And, in fact, we have said if a State improperly precludes you from developing a claim, then there is no deference owed to the State. So what we're really looking at was, was the Federal hearing properly granted?  You did not argue Alderson Reporting Company that on the basis of the evidence produced at the Federal hearing, that this man was not intellectually disabled.  You have put all your eggs in the basket of, on the record that didn't permit a hearing, he didn't make out a threshold finding.

If I decide -- have to decide whether or not he presented enough evidence to get a hearing, I would say you lose. Now, that's why it's important to me to know.  Are we trying to decide here whether there was enough evidence, such that the State under Federal law was unreasonable in not granting him a hearing, there I look at the standards of Williams, and I think you lose.

And under Louisiana law, I don't think you disagree with this, I don't think anybody could disagree with this, under Louisiana law, you have a hearing when the defendant has come forward, and it's -- the burden is on the defendant -- but when the defendant has come forward with some evident -- some evidence that raises a reasonable doubt as to his mental capacity.

It's only after Atkins is decided that adaptive becomes -- becomes relevant. But I didn't -- I wanted to ask you something in this record that's disturbing, and maybe you can explain it.  There is a brief -- you know it; it's by Justice Calogero -- that says there were 18 people who were sentenced to death and -- and before Atkins.  Then Atkins is decided.

And the standard is, as Justice Breyer suggested and you agreed, the one that comes from Dunn. And what I understand Mr. Brumfield to be saying is, look, all I need is some evidence.  The evidence that was in the trial record, even though it was pre-Atkins, the evidence was -- that was in the trial record was, I Alderson Reporting Company had a very low IQ, 75.  In addition, there was some evidence of -- of adaptive deficits, even -- even though they weren't trying to prove this point, evidence came in that he didn't read very well, he didn't write very well, he had problems processing information.  So that there was all that evidence. And then you sort of top -- when you look at the -- what the court said, I mean, basically, each one of the three things that the court said was just wrong. You know, the 75 is evidence of disability, there was evidence of adaptive functioning, and this idea that the court had that evidence relating to an antisocial personality somehow precluded the finding of mental disability is wrong as well.

Is it unreasonable in saying there wasn't enough evidence, even though there has to be some, which is up to them pretty much how they say the some, but they're unreasonable in saying that there wasn't some evidence justifying a hearing.
