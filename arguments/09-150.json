So the answer is no, it's not the case that whenever you come across a victim of a crime and ask him questions, it's going to be admissible.  It depends.

But -- but in my mind, I see a line, and that line is dividing what I think of as the Confrontation Clause, Sir Walter Raleigh situation, which I have in my mind as people going into a room and saying, now write out your testimony, and they write it out in the form of an affidavit, or they send in a letter, and they say \"bye,\" and then they walk next door to the trial and introduce it.  I mean, that's Walter Raleigh, in my mind. And then, on the other side of the line, is an -- evidentiary rules that are basically in State cases run by the State.  And they sometimes let hearsay in, and they sometimes don't, and they make reliability, et cetera, judgments in developing their -- their decision as to how hearsay exceptions will work.  Okay? Now, why don't I like emergency to draw that?  The reason I don't like the word \"emergency\" is I  think police do lots of things other than handle emergency and develop testimony. There's a range of things that you would describe as investigating the circumstance.  There's no danger.  There have been a string of robberies.  They go around and ask the grocery store people and everything what happened.  Now, I don't know why we should keep out evidence that, say, is given in that situation by a confederate.  It turns out he was the assistant -- why? And if I don't like that, I don't like the emergency rule as doing the -- as doing the work there, and I'm looking for something else.
