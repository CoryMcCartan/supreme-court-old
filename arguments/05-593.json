","counsel":[1]},"caseNumber":"05-593","date":"2006-10-30T08:00:00.000Z","speakers":[{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"text":"We'll hear argument first this morning in Osborn v. Haley. Mr. Grant. "},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":3,"text":"Why is it a wholly State law claim if the principal matter is whether this Federal employee is immune from suit? That's the threshold question that has to be answered. It's determined wholly by Federal law, so you must get through that Federal law gateway before you can go any place else in the suit."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":3,"text":"But that -- it's not it never happened as though the Federal employee was off in Hong Kong. He was there on the premises. He is claiming that whatever he did was within the scope of his authority. It seems like it's a question of phraseology that you're dealing with."},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":4,"text":"But I think Justice Ginsburg's point, and it concerns me as well, is that the Government is entitled to say that during the time the event occurred, i.e., the firing, he was on duty and he refrained from committing any unlawful act."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"text":"But the actual statutory language refers to acting within the scope of employment at the time of the incident, and so a certification based on the view that at the time of the alleged incident, he was acting entirely within his scope would seem to be within the language of the statute."},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":4,"text":"Well, but the question is what the district court should examine, and the statute talks about the incident out of which the claim arose. So that necessarily requires the Government to look at the complaint, see the incident out of which this claim arises, whether or not the claim is true, and to certify it."},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":4,"text":"\"Out of which the claim arose\" it seems to me is of some importance. But the dissenting judges in the First Circuit case, Wood, didn't think it was important. I'm not sure they were right about that."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"text":"Well how is it -- I mean, that line is awfully difficult to draw. You assert he didn't do it versus something else. But it's easy, let's say it's an assault case and the person says, you hit me, and the person says, well, it was entirely an accident; I was gesticulating with my hand so it wasn't, wouldn't have met the requirements for the tort. Now, are they denying the incident in that case?"},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"text":"But it's not just a characterization. If it's something that has, for example, a mental element, the plaintiff can assert, you did that with malice aforethought and the defendant can say, no, I didn't. Now, is that a characterization or is that a denial of the incident?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":5,"text":"Why isn't it the denial of an element of the claim? There's no recovery for assault if the mental element is what the Chief Justice just described in his hypo, and if in fact that is an element of the claim how do you draw a distinction between that and the existence or nonexistence of any act at all."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":5,"text":"Well, I'm not asking about certain cases. I just want to know analytically how you do it or how you think we're supposed to do it."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":5,"text":"Well, in this case the immunity defense is, number one, as you said, the Government forthrightly said at the beginning right in terms of the statute that he was acting within the scope of his employment. Secondarily, as you said, the Government in effect elaborated on that and said the reason he was not acting outside the scope of his employment is that these acts which would have been outside scope didn't happen. Why is that any different from the claim in the Chief Justice's hypo that there was no intent to harm?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":5,"text":"It's a claim upon which the immunity depends. The immunity is claimed -- the immunity claimed here is that at the time in question he was not acting outside the scope of his employment. The reason he was not acting outside the scope was that he didn't do what they say he did."},{"name":"JUSTICE ALITO","id":6,"text":"In this case, if Mr. Haley had said, I had some conversations with the private employer and the plaintiff's name was mentioned during the conversations, but I never told them to discharge her, would this, would that be something -- would your argument apply there?"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":3,"text":"Well, is it? I mean, that's -- the problem that I have with your argument, Mr. Grant, is that in life things are often not, it happened or it didn't happen. There is a middle ground, which is this officer is saying, I was there at the relevant time or place and when I was there everything that I did was within the scope of my employment, I didn't do anything that was outside the scope of my employment."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":7,"text":"I don't understand why anyone would want to come out the way you urge us to come out. Why would it make any sense to give a Federal employee the benefit of trial in Federal court when he committed the act, and then you debate about whether it was, whether there was liability or not, and yet deprive him of the benefit of a Federal court when he denies that he did anything at all? Why would you want one set of cases to remain in the State court and the other set of cases to go to Federal court?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":7,"text":"Well, I mean, that's what we're debating, whether the line is there or not, and as you've seen from the discussion, there is at least some ambiguity in it. There being ambiguity, why should we find a line that doesn't make any sense?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":7,"text":"But that can happen when in fact the certification of the Attorney General turns out to be wrong and there isn't any immunity. Still, the whole thing is going to be tried in Federal court."},{"name":"JUSTICE STEVENS","id":8,"text":"But Mr. Grant, I'm a little puzzled. Why is the discovery in the Federal system any less valuable in the State system?"},{"name":"JUSTICE STEVENS","id":8,"text":"Isn't that only summary for the purpose of deciding whether the removal was proper?"},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"text":"It's not for deciding whether removal -- I thought the statute says that the Attorney General's certification is conclusive with respect to removal."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"text":"Well, what does it mean to say that the certification is conclusive with respect to scope of employment for purposes of removal if it doesn't mean that it's conclusive, if you're going to have judicial review that is going to address the question of removal as opposed to the validity of the certification on the merits?"},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"text":"So you're saying it's only conclusive if it's right?"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":3,"text":"Suppose, Mr. Grant, that the district court had said, I'm going to deny the substitution of the United States as the defendant, but I realize that this is a debatable question, so I'm not going to order a remand until the defendant and the United States have had a chance to challenge my initial ruling that I deny the substitution of the United States. Suppose that it had happened that way? Would you have any right to get back in the State court? Wouldn't that properly go to a court of appeals?"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":3,"text":"Well, suppose that happened, and then the court of appeals said the United States should have been substituted?"},{"name":"JUSTICE ALITO","id":6,"text":"But your position is that the Attorney General's certification is conclusive - - is not conclusive in those situations in which the Attorney General doesn't draw the line properly between an event denying answer and an event characterizing answer? Whenever the Attorney General is wrong on that very nuanced decision in some instances, then the Attorney General's certification is not conclusive?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":7,"text":"Mr. Grant, these items we've been discussing are perhaps the more important features of the case. But your argument in your brief didn't begin with those. It began with the assertion that there is no jurisdiction to review the district court's remand order at all. I take it you're not abandoning that, are you?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":7,"text":"Then why was it first in your brief and not first in your argument?"},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"text":"There is at least considerable tension with 1447(d), though, and 2679(d)(2), in that that specifically says that for purposes of removal, the Attorney General's certification is conclusive. And it doesn't, if you look at 2679, it suggests, you'd think that case would proceed in Federal court rather than be immediately remanded without the availability of review."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"text":"This is a different type of jurisdictional statute in that there is concern on Congress's part here to provide a Federal forum for the adjudication of whether something is within the scope of a Federal employee's duty. It's not inconceivable, but it would seem illogical to specifically provide for review of that determination but then have that review take place in State court rather than Federal court."},{"name":"JUSTICE ALITO","id":6,"text":"But here not only, not only does it say that the Attorney General's certification is conclusive for purposes of removal, but there is no mention about remand in relation to a case that is removed after the Attorney General's certification. Whereas by contrast, where the Attorney General doesn't certify and the case is removed, the statute does address the issue of remand. So if you put those two things together, isn't it perfectly clear that Congress did not want these cases that are removed on the Attorney General's certification to be remanded?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":7,"text":"I would have thought your answer would have been even if, even if the remand was improper, even if it is the case that, what is it, (d)(2) envisions that the suit remain in the Federal court. Nonetheless, if there is an erroneous remand, it is still a remand that is covered by the prohibition of review. I mean, we said in other cases that even when the remand is wrong, the remand is not reviewable."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":9,"text":"If that's your answer, can I go back to the other main issue for a second? I would have thought that your case, unfortunately for you in my mind, is the classic case where there should be jurisdiction because the AG is supposed to say look, I don't think anything happened, okay? So he was doing his job all day. But if something did happen, I'll tell you what, it was within the scope of his employment. And apparently, that's just what they did say here. And then it got mixed up in the courts below. In other words, if he made some phone calls and even if he mentioned the employee, even if he said something improper, it was within the scope of his employment, which is just what they said. So because of that, it seems to me this makes a lot of complexity out of nothing. Now you explain what your answer is."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":9,"text":"In the district court he didn't say, if something happened here, it was in the scope of his employment? I thought he had. Maybe he hadn't. I thought he had, but I'll ask him that."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":9,"text":"In the district court I thought he said that."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":9,"text":"Well, it was there first, but you can argue in the defense alternative, I think nothing happened. But if the plaintiff can convince a jury otherwise, fine, but then what they can convince him of is within the scope of his employment. Now did that happen in the district court, that they said something like that or not?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":9,"text":"Well, why can't they do that, which is just what Wood says they can do, if anybody, you know, thinks that's valid? But the - - what's the problem then? Because I would have thought that the reason this case appears difficult is because yours is a case where the AG should be able to come in and remove it."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":9,"text":"But it's wrong in that, isn't it?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":9,"text":"I mean, the Wood issue was the issue of where if anything happened, of course it's outside the scope. It's like one employee shoots another, you know. There is nothing to do with scope of employment there, it's plainly outside. And of course, this act, in my view then, then, was that this is not an act that allows the AG to defend that kind of thing. But if it's arguable at least that something happened, if it happened at all it was within the scope of employment, the AG can defend it."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":9,"text":"What's the problem with - - there should be a problem with what I say from your point of view, so - -"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":9,"text":"So you're saying they have abandoned the argument?"},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"text":"Thank you, Mr. Grant. Mr. Hallward-Driemeier. "},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"text":"So what if the Attorney General certifies and removes a case in a criminal case, a case clearly not within the statute? What happens then?"},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"text":"No, no, on the procedure, he follows the procedure meticulously; it's just wrong. It's a criminal case. The statute says he can do it in a civil case. On the other hand the statute also says that his certification is conclusive."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"text":"Yes, this one is a civil one and that's a criminal, but I'm just trying to understand how broad your argument that this is not subject to further review goes."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"text":"Well I thought your analogy to Willingham was a strong one until you go back and read the statute. Willingham is a very different statutory predicate. It's acting under color of law. This is much more specific. At the time of the incident, he was acting within his scope, so I'm not sure the analogy holds up."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"text":"But yet that would be a good argument if the statute said the Attorney General can certify that the employee did not do anything outside the scope of his employment, but it's phrased in the affirmative. He has to certify that he was acting within the scope of his employment."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":9,"text":"So that's the issue then. And what I -- is my, my question for you is this, let's imagine not this case, which as I said I think is too complicated and probably is one that the Government should be able to defend, but suppose it's an assault like Wood's, a sexual assault and there is absolutely no doubt that if it happened it was outside the scope of employment, everybody concedes it but Government. And the Government's position is, nothing happened. All right? Nothing happened. You say Government, would you like to argue that if something happened, and they may be able to prove something, something like a movement? No, we agree there was nothing like that, we agree nothing like that happened; we are not going to defend on any scope of employment ground. All we are arguing is that ordinary work went on and that was within the scope of employment. Now, does this act cover it or not? Your view is yes and you read, you know I thought it was a close question but you read what I thought the other way in Wood, though it was obviously a close question. So what is your basic response to that?"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":3,"text":"That was the position of the district court, though, wasn't it?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":9,"text":"The basic point I think in Wood is this. I'm the district judge. And the Government, you come in and argue in the alternative. Nothing happened, but if it did happen it was within the scope of employment and they say there is no possibility. You'd say, plaintiff, I want to know here if there is a reasonable chance, maybe any chance, that a jury could find that something went on here that was within the scope of employment that shouldn't have. And if the answer to that question is no, the defendant wins either because of summary judgment or because -- no, sorry. I've gotten lost in what I said. Do you follow it?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":9,"text":"All right. Good, I'm glad that someone did. [Laughter.]"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":9,"text":"I was talking really about practicality of it. I don't think you can give me a case that is going to be hard for me as a district judge to decide because I'm going to ask you, the Government, to tell me if anything went on here that might have been within the scope of employment. And I look at what you're saying; if you say no, if you say no you can't defend it. If you say yes, you can defend it and that's going to be the end of it as long as your view is based on a reasonable reading of the record."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":9,"text":"And as long as a jury could find that there is a view of the record such that the plaintiff might prove something wrong that it was within the scope of employment, such as finger wagging that hits her forehead, for example, you can defend it. What's the problem?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":9,"text":"The only problem is if you admit that you can't prove anything like that."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":9,"text":"No, not a fortiori, for the reason that Congress wrote this statute not to give the defendant the right to call in the Government to defend him no matter what he did. The reason that Congress wrote the statute was to repeal the Westfall case, which was a question of the scope of immunity, which was the question of the scope of Government responsibility to take away that limited determination in Westfall. That was the only point. Congress could have written a statute the way. What's your response to that?"},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"text":"But what happens in a case where the certification is clearly wrong? I mean, you get into a fight with your neighbor. It's got nothing to do with your employment at all but the Attorney General certifies that it does. You know: \"They are always thinking about your cases. You must have been thinking about it at the time.\" That certification goes into the district court. The district court looks at it and says this is ridiculous, throws it out, then that State law assault case proceeds in Federal court?"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":3,"text":"Well what about the, Lamagno, where the question was, was the employee working within the scope of his employment or was he off on a frolic of his own? I think that's the kind of question that the Chief Justice put to you. The certification, if it were wrong, the Attorney General said what he was doing was within the scope of employment and turned out he was on a drunken binge with his friends and they got in his car and killed someone. If that certification within the scope was wrong and instead he is on a frolic of his own, then the United States isn't substituted."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":3,"text":"I thought that that case was about, was the certification reviewable?"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":3,"text":"But the Court said that that could be reviewed."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":3,"text":"Right."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":7,"text":"What does that mean? Does that mean that if the district court finds that in fact the defendant was not acting within the scope of his employment, the United States is eliminated as the defendant and the individual employee is resubstituted?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":7,"text":"Where, where does that come from?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":7,"text":"Maybe the United States should remain the party defendant and the United States should pay which would be the, you know, the price of the Attorney General's certification. He should be careful what he certifies."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"text":"Well, they wouldn't have discretion in that case, though, because the statute says the Attorney General's certification is conclusive for purposes of removal."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"text":"I thought maybe your answer, one alternative answer, would have been that you can't remand the case but you can still dismiss it."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"text":"It would still be conclusive for purposes of removal, but it doesn't mean it's conclusive for purposes of subject matter jurisdiction."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":5,"text":"Couldn't it be conclusive for purposes of removal jurisdiction, but still leave the district court with discretion to remand on the grounds that, although it had removal jurisdiction, in fact the premise of that removal jurisdiction was wrong, and it would therefore remand, in effect, because the only claim it had before it was the equivalent of a pendent claim."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":5,"text":"In that case it would be reviewable."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":7,"text":"That's, that's what the district court said it was, though, isn't it? Didn't it -- wasn't the district court remanding for lack of jurisdiction?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":7,"text":"So you want us to review the, the assertion of the district court that it was remanding for, I mean that would mean every case would, would be reviewable."},{"name":"JUSTICE STEVENS","id":8,"text":"Let me go back to the Chief Justice's hypo a little earlier. Could the district judge at that point dismiss the case without prejudice to refiling in the State court?"},{"name":"JUSTICE STEVENS","id":8,"text":"It would be consistent with the court having jurisdiction to dispose of the case."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":3,"text":"Then it's more than pendent jurisdiction, because pendent jurisdiction leaves it up to the Federal court to either retain the State claim or send it back. So this is -- what you're suggesting is something other than pendent jurisdiction."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"text":"Well, the jurisdiction wouldn't depend on that. Justice Ginsburg's point that there's more than pendent jurisdiction here I take it is because these are not separate State claims appended to what you thought was a Federal claim. This is the same claim that you initially thought was a Federal claim and then it turned into a purely State law claim, and that may be analyzed quite differently for purposes of jurisdiction."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":5,"text":"So you're saying there are two claims, one claim is raised by the defense, and if you look at that claim which is by definition Federal, then it's fair to look at the original State claim by analogy as a pendent claim?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":5,"text":"Is that fair?"},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":4,"text":"What happens if the Attorney General doesn't certify and it goes to State court? I take it one of the concerns we have here is that there will be a deprivation of jury trial if the certification is wrong and if it's in Federal court. Suppose that there is a denial of certification. Then under (d)(3) - -"},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":4,"text":"-- the employee can ask for a certification decision. I take it that's a Federal law defense that the, or a Federal law point, that the State court must hear and so now we're back in State court?"},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":4,"text":"And we still don't have a jury trial and if that's so I'm not sure if that helps you or helps the Petitioner."},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":4,"text":"But in my case I guess I don't think it ever gets to district court because there's no certification, but then the employee can ask the State court to have a bench trial on the scope of employment. Am I right about that?"},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":4,"text":"But my point is I suppose the Government can just say, we're not going to make the certification and we're not going to remove."},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":4,"text":"So then the State court still has to have the bench trial on the scope of employment."},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":4,"text":"I'm not sure if that helps. It seems to me that might be an argument for limiting the inquiry just so that we can avoid having bench trials in almost every case."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":9,"text":"Right, but that's the strongest argument I thought the other way initially, that suppose the issue is whether he is on a frolic of his own. That you resolve in a bench trial. If the answer he was, okay, it stays in the Federal court anyway. I understand that. But if you're going to take your position whether, say, it's a sexual assault as it was in Wood and the question is well, was there a sexual assault or not, and if there was it's clearly outside of the scope of employment, well, then you're going to have all these things resolved in a bench trial and actually it's supposed to normally be before a jury, for example."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":3,"text":"Is that so? If the employee is resubstituted, it's going on now, the United States is not a party, just the Federal employee, but it's staying in Federal court under this pendent jurisdiction-like theory, wouldn't either party be entitled to a jury trial?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":7,"text":"Mr. Grant, could I come back for -- I'm sorry. I have the wrong counsel. Mr. Hallward-Driemeier - -"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":7,"text":"What is your response to the application of 1447(d)? You say that it does not apply where it's apparent on the face that the remand is improper?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":7,"text":"Right, right."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":7,"text":"Wouldn't somebody always be able to bring an appeal asserting that to be the case - -"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":7,"text":"And wouldn't that destroy the whole purpose of 1447(d), which is to stop this ping-pong?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":7,"text":"But the response to that is that our opinions show that even an erroneous remand is nonetheless governed by 1447(d). There are a lot of erroneous remands and this would just be, just be another one."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":5,"text":"Isn't the problem, and maybe I'm missing, and I may be missing something here, but isn't the problem with your argument is that the statute didn't come out and say you can't remand. The statute said, for purposes of removal, the certification is conclusive, and that allows for the kind of dichotomy that you and I were talking with before. A court can say look, I know that I have article III jurisdiction here, but in point of fact I am, I am remanding because what you and I are calling here the pendent claim does not support any of the Government's theory. If that's the case, then under 1447(d), there could be a review of it because it was not a jurisdictional ruling. But if on the contrary, the judge said, as I think the judge said here, I am remanding because based on this analysis, I do not have jurisdiction, i.e., the judge went against the statute saying that jurisdiction is conclusive. That is an erroneous jurisdictional ruling, and as Justice Scalia said, we have said over and over again, however erroneous it may be, it is not reviewable."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"text":"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Grant, you have four minutes remaining. "},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"text":"Well, there was nothing expressed about Thermtron, and yet we recognized an exception there."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":3,"text":"How about the defense of, I was on the job and everything I did on the job was within the scope of my employment?"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":3,"text":"But then you're left with this question Justice Scalia raised. If it's ambiguous, an employee says I did everything within the scope of my employment, I did nothing improper. They allege I did something improper. I didn't. I was a faithful servant. The negligent employee will be allowed the Federal forum, but the one who was a loyal, careful employee has to be in the State court.
