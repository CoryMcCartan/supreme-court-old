Are you just saying Basic is wrong, or are you saying that something has changed since Basic?  Because usually that's what we look for when we decide whether to reverse a case, something that makes the question fundamentally different now than when we decided it.

Well, similarly, here, they're saying:        We don't have to show that the markets incorporate every piece of information.  We think they incorporate this information, and itâ€™s a general rule, they do incorporate most information. The other side wants to show they didn't incorporate this.  That's fine.

But everybody in this case bought on the New York Stock Exchange and our theory of this case is that the stock exchange did absorb the information and the price went up and then went down. Alderson Reporting Company Now, what -- what reason is there for purposes of certification to go beyond the efficient market?  Is it good enough?  I mean, why not?  They all bought on the exchange.
