You either have to say it was designed for a different regime, and therefore, has no effect now after Booker, or else you have to expand it beyond what it says, because may depart from the applicable sentencing range on a ground not identified, under the mandatory guidelines, they were identified grounds for departure. And you had some -- the court could look at those and say, gee, am I going to pick one of these, if so I'll let him know.  But you can depart now simply on the ground that you don't agree with the -- with what the Guidelines say as -- is that what you would call a ground of departure? It's simply a ground of disagreement, I would suppose.  Why shouldn't we hold 32(h) simply. Simply has no -- no application under the new system? Or at least hold that all it applies to are departures within the meaning of the old mandatory guidelines system?  Which is a much narrower category of departures."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"I don't think it is counter-intuitive to provide -- to -- to require notice when the number of grounds is finite.

Now, in the bad old days, when the statute said 20 to 40, and the judge decided to give you 40, he didn't have to give you notice of why he was giving you the highest sentence. And now that we've returned to a system that is closer to that, why should we interpret 32(h) as imposing a very difficult to comply with requirement that didn't exist under the -- under the pre-pre-Booker system?"},{"name":"JUSTICE ALITO","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Suppose the district court in this case had said I'm considering an above-Guidelines sentence based on facts that are in the record in the pre-sentence report to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant.

And I -- this seems to me to be a clear case of what was in the judge's mind.  She said I have a record here of repeated e-mails to this woman, threatening to kill her, threatening to kill her new husband, threatening to kill her mother.  He did it again and again and again. I have seen this person, he appeared before me.  It is my educated prediction that he will do it again.  So I'm going to put him away for as long as I can. That's -- her reasoning process is not at all mysterious. What notice is the defendant lacking?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":6,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Why -- why isn't that an equally response to what Justice Ginsburg just gave as a recitation of what the what the judge had said."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":6,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"She quoted and summarized the judge saying he's going to do it again."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":6,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Anybody knows that what the judge is getting at is I'm going to put him away as long as I can put him away.

That is they put 3553(a) into 32(d)(2)(F); so they made a change there and they said the judge could ask to have these things included in the pre-sentence report; but they left (H) looking like it's dealing just with the guidelines.  Why couldn't the Court say well, we didn't put 3553 in (h), and so it's not there?"},{"name":"JUSTICE ALITO","id":4,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Well, why shouldn't this rule be dealt with by further rulemaking?  It is very clear that when 32(h) was adopted, departure had a specific meaning under the Guidelines.  And what we're talking about now was not contemplated at all by the rulemakers at that time. Now, applying 3553(a) in this situation raises different problems, and there are issues regarding the specificity of the notice that's required and the timing of the notice.  Why shouldn't this be dealt with by further rulemaking when those -- where those things can be handled in a comprehensive way rather than by the haphazard development of case law by the courts of appeals if we agree with your position."},{"name":"JUSTICE ALITO","id":4,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Are you saying --"},{"name":"JUSTICE ALITO","id":4,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Are you saying that if they had in mind at the time that Booker might be coming down the road."},{"name":"JUSTICE ALITO","id":4,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"There would be non-Guidelines variances from the Sentencing Guidelines."},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":7,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"May I ask you this question about the rule:  It says before the court may depart from the applicable sentencing range on a ground not identified for departure.

A case that would qualify for a Guidelines departure would, by definition, be a case in which the 3553(a) factors justified a sentence other than a Guidelines sentence?  So I don't understand why there's any need to go through the departure analysis any longer at all."},{"name":"JUSTICE ALITO","id":4,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"I just don't understand that.  You're not -- a court -- a sentencing court, after concluding that there is no ground for a departure under Booker and the later cases, then has to consider the 3553(a) question. So the decision about the departures is irrelevant.  It is not dispositive; and, if the court finds that the case qualified for a Guidelines departure, as I said before, by definition, that is going to be a case where the 3553(a) factors warranted a non-Guidelines sentence anyway.  So it seems like a useless appendage at this point."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":9,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Well, why is the 32(h) obligation relevant?  That is, looking through the history of it, I see that in 32(i)(C) it says that the government has to allow the parties' attorneys to comment on the determination of the probation officer and other matters relating to an appropriate sentence. Then, in a case called Burns v. United States, this Court says that that right to comment includes a right to notice. And so all that 32(h) did was to take what was already the law and make specific that it includes a right to notice.  I take it that was what they were up to. But even if you didn't have 32(h), you would have precisely the same right once you got 32(i)(C) together with the case of Burns. So I don't know where that leaves me, except thinking it doesn't matter, because the defendant has precisely the same right either way.  And I guess it's easier just to say \"departure\" means generally all kinds of departures including not applying it. That's not a stretch of the language.  It is quite right it is not consistent with what they thought they were up to, but not -- it is -- maybe before -- if they had passed this before Hawaii became a State, you could say:  Well, they didn't think it would apply in Hawaii. So what?  I mean would you decrease that, General?"},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":7,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"That is an abuse of discretion standardized?"},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":7,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Unworkable or is there just as many impracticalities as the rule."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":5,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Why isn't it just whatever is the reason that the judge is considering is going outside the advisory Guidelines, whatever that reason is, just say it.
