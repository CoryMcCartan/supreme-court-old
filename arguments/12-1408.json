I mean, it says \"'wages' means all remuneration for employment.\"  All remuneration -- wages means all remuneration for employment paid basically for any service of whatever nature performed by an employee. Now, I agree with you that it's the same definition for the withholding.  But Congress, it passes the withholding change with conflicting interpretations. So it wouldn't be the first time that Congress passed a statute to say:  We don't care what the conflicting interpretations are; ignoring that, you are going to withhold this money, period.  And it said, whether it's other than wages or not. I grant you, they might have thought they had to pass it, but so?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":8,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"We could also look at it as they didn't have to pass it.

It -- it --  on certain, different people tell them different things.  They say, we don't care; do it anyway.  And that's what this statute basically says: Withhold anyway."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":8,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"And maybe -- could we say that?  Could we say, well, in our opinion you are right. Both statutes cover supplemental unemployment benefits.

Now, that wouldn't be the first time either. So -- but Congress did think it.  So what weight am I supposed to give to what Congress thought then about what an earlier Congress, namely, the Congress that passed the wage definition in the withholding statute thought?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":8,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Well, yes.  But that was so much the more so, you see?  They had authority saying it wasn't wages.  That doesn't mean that authority was correct.  And -- and so that's why they passed the statute."},{"name":"JUSTICE ALITO","id":5,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Well, the government explains 3402(o) on the ground that there had been prior admin -- IRS administrative decisions exempting certain types of SUB payments from the definition of wages.  And that -- that can explain that language.  The language that they are -- that SUB payments are to be treated as if they were wages doesn't necessarily mean that all of those SUB payments are not wages. It does necessarily mean that at least some of them -- or suggests at least some of them are not wages.
