Now, those are the two questions that I'm very bothered about. I don't know what the rules ought to be there. That is, do you think that a person can put anything on the Internet? Do you think they can put anything on television even if it attacks, say, the most private things of a private individual? Does Maryland's -- does Maryland's law actually prohibit that?

You could have a judge make the decision, since the First Amendment is involved, not the jury, and the judge could say whether in this instance it was reasonable for the defendant to think that it was important to interfere with the emotional life of that individual. You could say if that was so, there will still be no -- there would be no punitive damages. There could be ordinary damages. You could remove all protection from the defendant in an instance where the defendant nonetheless knew, actually knew, that they were going to cause an individual who's private severe injury, emotional injury, irrespective of their public message.
