There are overzealous government agents. There always have been and I am sure that, assuming all of the misbehavior described here is correct, I'm sure it is not the first time this has happened. Government agents sometimes get overzealous. But why should there be this extraordinary remedy when the overzealousness happens to be attached to a desire to get a piece of land, whereas if they had just picked on this guy because they didn't like the way he combed his hair or for any other reason and had done the same things you wouldn't have your Bivens action, right?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":3,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"No, no.

That's different from a freestanding cause of action. And I share Justice Scalia's concern. It seems to me in thinking about this case there is -- there could be something very wrong here, going after a person because of what he's done. Suppose the Government wants somebody to be a witness in a trial and he won't do it, and they go around hurting his business, they go around invading his property and so forth. That to me is outrageous and you might have an argument that there should be a Bivens cause of action for that. And Justice Scalia's question -- I had the same question -- is why do we think it to the property? The essence here, the essence of what's going on, is that they're being vindictive against this person.
