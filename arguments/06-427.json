Ms. Mahoney. "},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":4,"text":"May I ask you a preliminary question, Ms. Mahoney? And that is, we are told that at the time this issue arose, the practice itself was all right, and it was all right for one school to invite students from another school to join the invitee school's practice. And now I take it that it's no longer permissible, that one school's, one school's practice, is reserved for its own students and not -- others are not invited. But if it was permissible under the association's rules to invite students from other schools, then why is it impermissible to talk it up? I mean, you can do it, but you can't talk about it?"},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":5,"text":"So in speech terms, there were alternative means to get the message out."},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":5,"text":"I think the briefs are - - I think it's fair to characterize the Respondent's brief this way, or fair to concentrate on Pickering. It seems to me that Pickering is the key here, and I took away that impression from your brief. If we said that it's commercial speech, I think that's a little far off the mark. If we said it's an unconstitutional condition, I'm not sure that helps either side that much, either."},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":5,"text":"In Umbehr we said, the Court said, that in the independent contractor cases the interests of either party, the government or the contractor, are not quite so intense as they are with a public employee. I thought that made sense when I read it. I'm not so sure it does any more."},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":5,"text":"Well, I suppose we could construct a hypothetical where we could say there's a very strong interest in the contractor. So I'm not sure that that works as a general theorem."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"text":"What about if, what if the association had a rule that members, school officials, shall not criticize the decisions of the association?"},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"text":"It's germane. In other words, you can criticize other things, but if you're going to join this group we think it's important for their public stature not to be criticized by members."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"text":"There's no more public concern about when spring practice is. If you think there should be, you know, two playoff tiers rather than three and you criticize the association for that and they say well, you're suspended for a year and all that."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"text":"What about criticizing officials?"},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"text":"No, I mean three days later, you know, the school -- the coach writes an editorial saying there were lousy calls in the game last week."},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":5,"text":"And how would you balance it?"},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":5,"text":"And how would you commence?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":6,"text":"Ms. Mahoney, on that point, can I just take you back to square one for a second? I'm with you in your explanation that the speech at issue here probably was fairly understood as being for, you know, the communication here as being a violation of the rule. Could you, though, tell me, would it have been -- I guess I have two questions. Would it have been a violation of the rule if the coach had sent the letter to eighth grade students in the school itself, those who were already formally enrolled and who might be going out for football the next fall? And number two, what is exactly the interest in preventing recruiting, as you describe it, when the letters are aimed at people who have already signed, I think you referred to it as, an enrollment contract? So there's every reason to believe they're going to be in that school next year. What is the interest? And would that interest have supported a ban on letters to the already enrolled eighth grade kids?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":6,"text":"Okay, so they had signed up to go to Brentwood. So where does the recruiting come in?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":6,"text":"So it boils down to saying that when they've signed the enrollment contract that's not the end of the, in effect, the issue."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":6,"text":"And there is a sensible practical way in which recruiting goes on even among those who have signed up. Okay."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"text":"And what is the interest behind the anti-recruiting rule?"},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"text":"They could have determined that it's particularly harmful to the public schools who don't have the option of recruiting while the private schools do?"},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":5,"text":"Could the association bar Brentwood from contacting public school students altogether?"},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":5,"text":"About enrollment. About enrollment."},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":5,"text":"Well, like if Brentwood, let's assume -- I think it's true -- is rather well-known in the State, and if they send you a solicitation form to enroll, everybody knows they've got a great athletic program, so we say you can't solicit any high school students."},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":5,"text":"I haven't kept track of your time, but if we're going to rule for you we have to reach the due process problem. And at some point after you finish discussing what you wish to on free speech, I actually find that a somewhat more difficult issue."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":4,"text":"But then that's part of the trophy, whatever it is when you win at the end of the year."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"text":"Is there any other?"},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"text":"Thank you, Ms. Mahoney. Mr. Himmelfarb? "},{"name":"JUSTICE STEVENS","id":7,"text":"May I ask this, what is your response to the, one of your earlier questions. Suppose they sent out a general brochure to all the graduating grammar school students to -- advertising that they come up to Brentwood and so forth and so on, and the rule prohibited that? Would that rule be valid?"},{"name":"JUSTICE STEVENS","id":7,"text":"But isn't the coach recruiting just a subcategory of a broader - -"},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"text":"I'm sorry; you think it might be a reasonable or unreasonable?"},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"text":"It's a close call whether a school can send a brochure to 8th graders that is not limited to athletics telling them about their school?"},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"text":"What if the mailing was limited to people who had signed contracts with - - students, not just football players but everyone who else had signed enrollment contracts with the school? General brochure listing all the things you can do at the school including athletics, including -- you know, other extracurricular activities? Is that all right?"},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"text":"Or would it be unreasonable for the TSSAA to prohibit that?"},{"name":"JUSTICE STEVENS","id":7,"text":"I'm not asking you about the school for the rule. I'm trying to figure out what's the scope of the First Amendment protection."},{"name":"JUSTICE STEVENS","id":7,"text":"You do agree at some point the First Amendment would prohibit some kind of rule."},{"name":"JUSTICE STEVENS","id":7,"text":"Is that permissible, in weighing the -- both sides of the equation to consider the advantages -- I mean the justifications for the speech?"},{"name":"JUSTICE STEVENS","id":7,"text":"-- justification for the rule in this case and the justification for the rule that would prohibit the general solicitation I described."},{"name":"JUSTICE STEVENS","id":7,"text":"Is it the same justification, but the justification is a little stronger in one hypo than the other?"},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":5,"text":"It seems to me that, turning to the state action for a moment, one of the justifications for finding state action that is there is no other real choice, that they have, other than to - - if they want to play athletics in Tennessee other than to join this association. And yet at the opening of your argument, you said oh, well it's voluntary. So It seems to me that your speech argument is inconsistent with one of the justifications for finding state action to begin with."},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":5,"text":"But that's somewhat inconsistent with one of the most forceful arguments for finding state action to begin it, i.e., that you have to join the school if you really want to compete with most of the schools. You have to join the association."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"text":"Thank you, Mr. Himmelfarb. Mr. Blumstein? "},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":5,"text":"Did it serve the suspension or has that been stayed? Was it suspended from competition for two years? That was the penalty."},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":5,"text":"Did it -- did that take effect?"},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":5,"text":"One year - -"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":4,"text":"And the fine has not been paid. The fine."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":4,"text":"Mr. Blumstein, there's one feature of this that I find puzzling. You're making this a First Amendment case. But you joined an association that has such, certain rules and when one joins, one agrees to abide by the rules. Nothing in the world stops Brentwood from saying this anti-recruiting rule is a really bad rule, it is unfair to us; you could have written op ed pieces about it, the school could have talked about it, the school could have urged the board of education to drop it. Nothing stopped you from attacking this rule that you don't like. But when you signed on, the First Amendment doesn't give you license not to follow the rules that you disagree with."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":4,"text":"But isn't part of what you agree to is a organization that has a certain governance structure, the people in the organization decide, and then make public to all the members of the association what the rules are and how they're going to be interpreted?"},{"name":"JUSTICE STEVENS","id":7,"text":"Mr. Blumstein, am I not correct for purposes of our decision, if you're claiming constitutional protection, you're claiming that you'd be constitutionally protected even if you knew in advance that this particular communication would violate the rule and even if you did it deliberately? That's what your constitutional position is, is it not?"},{"name":"JUSTICE STEVENS","id":7,"text":"Is it or is it not?"},{"name":"JUSTICE STEVENS","id":7,"text":"It is."},{"name":"JUSTICE STEVENS","id":7,"text":"So that what really, you're -- it is sort of a side issue as to whether they really had adequate notice and so forth, insofar as we're talking about the First Amendment?"},{"name":"JUSTICE ALITO","id":8,"text":"What if the state set up two athletic leagues and one had an anti-recruiting rule and the other didn't, and they were equally strong, and you chose to join the one that had the anti-recruiting league. Would it be a violation of the First Amendment in your opinion?"},{"name":"JUSTICE ALITO","id":8,"text":"Yes, both are governmental."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":9,"text":"But your claim here is not that they didn't apply the rules fairly, your claim is that they applied the rules."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":9,"text":"That's right. Fairly. Fairly as they were written. But you say even if they did apply them fairly, that's no good."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":9,"text":"I just wanted to be clear on that."},{"name":"JUSTICE ALITO","id":8,"text":"And even if was purely voluntary and even if you had two choices but you chose the -- you chose to join the association with the anti-recruiting rule, there would be a First Amendment problem?"},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"text":"So what if you decided to offer bonuses to 8th graders, a thousand dollars -- and of course that's, I assume that's against the rules in Tennessee -- would you have -- would that be covered by your First Amendment right?"},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"text":"Why not?"},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"text":"But that's not the line that we draw elsewhere in the First Amendment."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":4,"text":"Mr. Blumstein, you're making that distinction. Is there -- if the association says no school in this association can invite students enrolled in other schools to its practice, that's okay? Because that's conduct, right? If this is your statement, there's nothing to recruit for, because we don't allow it period."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":4,"text":"That would be okay."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":4,"text":"It's a little odd, isn't it, that they could do -- they could take the stronger measure but not the lesser measure of saying it's available but we don't want you to broadcast it?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":9,"text":"But not beneficial to the system. That's why the organization didn't like it. And I wanted to come back to something you said just a minute ago, that there's an obligation under the First Amendment to weigh the effects of speech. Is there? I mean, suppose a government organization simply comes out with a rule that is perfectly fair, and that happens to give due weight to the fact that it's restricting speech, but the government organization has frankly never considered it. They didn't sit down around a table and say now, look, this is going affect speech, let's be careful here. They didn't do that. They just promulgated a perfectly reasonable rule. Wouldn't we uphold that?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":9,"text":"They don't have to consider the matter, do they? They just have to get it right, whether they considered it or not."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":9,"text":"Certainly. We have to do that. Certainly we have to do it in assessing whether, what the government has done is okay. But you're saying it's invalid unless the government gathers together a group of people just to shoot the breeze about -- I don't know of any of our cases that require that."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":9,"text":"Well, I mean, you may criticize them when they get it -- when it comes out wrong. Then you can say, when the result is wrong, they should have considered it. But when it comes out right? Do you have any case where it comes out right and it's perfectly reasonable, we say tsk, tsk, oh, but even though it came out right, they didn't consider speech? We've never said anything like that."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":9,"text":"That's where you had an approval system where one party would be approved and another one wouldn't. Of course, in that situation, you have to engage case by case in making the weighing. But this is not an approval situation. It's the issuance of a rule that applies to everybody."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":6,"text":"Mr. Blumstein, it seems to me that Ms. Mahoney addressed that in response to a question from me. I said, in effect, that once a student has signed an enrollment contract, where is there any recruiting going on? And she said there is recruiting, and hence there is an interest in regulating recruiting, because not everybody who signs these contracts, or on behalf of whom those contracts are signed, end up going to the school. So that in fact, there is room for recruiting right up to the moment that the kid arrives in the fall and signs on the dotted line. What is your response to her response?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":6,"text":"Well, how many cases have there got to be before you would recognize the sufficiency of the asserted state interest?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":6,"text":"Well, we know that. They've signed the contract. So that's where we start. And you're saying, well, only about 5 percent of them weasel out of it later on and go to some other school. But why is 5 percent insufficient?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":6,"text":"So that if the kid comes and says, look, I'm going to Brentwood next fall and I'd like to tag along to a spring practice, they say okay. But that's not recruiting. The school hasn't initiated it. In this case, the school has initiated it by the letter. And it does sound like recruiting if you accept the proposition that the students aren't bound to go to the school even though their parents signed up and some of them don't. So I come back to my question. If taking your figure -- let's assume that only 5 percent, in fact, change their minds. Why doesn't -- why isn't there a legitimate interest in preventing recruiting within the 5 percent?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":6,"text":"Yeah, but would you answer my question? Why isn't that enough?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":6,"text":"Okay. It certainly can do that. There's no question about it. But it seems to me that the line that is being drawn is a line between contact which is initiated by the prospective student and proselytizing which is initiated by the school. Why isn't that a reasonable line?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":6,"text":"That's not what we've got before us."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":6,"text":"Okay. We're still talking about athletic contact."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":6,"text":"Okay. Maybe that would present a different kind of problem, but that's not what we've got here. What we've got here is contact through speech that was initiated by the coach."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":6,"text":"And I am saying that if the rule generally -- maybe quite imprecisely -- but if it generally distinguishes between that kind of proselytizing by a coach, and on the other hand contact that a kid initiates in the first place, isn't that roughly a fair line?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":6,"text":"The activity being tagging along to spring practice?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":6,"text":"But the answer to that is, they're not trying to prevent people, at least under this rule, they're not trying to prevent 8th grade kids from going to spring practice. They're trying to prevent coaches from proselytizing kids, and that's the distinction. Why isn't it a reasonable distinction?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":9,"text":"It was a letter from coach. It was a letter from coach. I mean, that to a young kid, that is recruiting. That is showing an interest on the part of the person who's going to decide who plays, an interest in you. I think it's entirely reasonable to consider that recruiting."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":4,"text":"Is it fair to say \"your coach\"? The letter was signed by your coach, not just coach."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":9,"text":"And did it say, by the way, everybody got this letter? Did it say that at the bottom?"},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":5,"text":"Weren't all these things that are being discussed before the factfinder, or was there some ex parte contact later which was the only evidence for what we're talking about now? I'm getting into the due process point."},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":5,"text":"But I mean, all of these matters were discussed and there was an opportunity to reply to all of these matters that we've just been talking about, correct?"},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":5,"text":"It doesn't seem to me like there's a strong case for a flawed hearing for a due process violation."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":10,"text":"What was the evidence?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":10,"text":"What was the evidence?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":10,"text":"I mean, at this late date, you've had trials. You're saying -- did you ask? With all these people under oath, haven't you had trials and everything?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":10,"text":"Did you ever ask the people who were at the meeting, what was the evidence you considered that we haven't had a chance to see?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":10,"text":"Did you or not?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":10,"text":"And then, and what did they say?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":10,"text":"All right. So there were some notes taken by investigators, which did they have anything new in them you hadn't seen before?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":10,"text":"What was in there that you had not seen before in the notes?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":10,"text":"I'm asking you: What was in the notes that were presented to the decisionmaker that you had not previously seen and therefore had no opportunity to rebut? What particularly and specifically? And it's surprising to me that you hesitate at this very late date if this is a serious issue."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":10,"text":"What did it say in the notes that you, a factual matter or some other, that you did not have a chance to reply to specifically?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":10,"text":"What you learned was the investigators had not spoken to Mr. King, and you previously did not know that, and if you had known that you would have said to the decisionmaker: The investigators did not speak to Mr. King. And if you had said that, how would this case be different?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":10,"text":"And the other side says, Mr. Bart King was part of the school and had something to do with this?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":10,"text":"Is that right."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":10,"text":"Well then, I don't understand what the relevance of this is."},{"name":"JUSTICE STEVENS","id":7,"text":"I thought your claim was that you had a witness available to testify, but you didn't put him on because you didn't think they were going into this issue. That's all."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":10,"text":"But I don't understand what Mr. King has to do with this if the other side is not claiming that Mr. King is part of your operation."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":10,"text":"Who considered it?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":10,"text":"Did you ask the people on the board of control, what role did Mr. King play in your decision?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":10,"text":"So that they might have reduced it ed it from $3,000 to less had they not been under the mistaken impression that Mr. King had something to do with you when he did it."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":10,"text":"And the probation was - - and the probation, which was for four years?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":10,"text":"And have you served the four years."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":10,"text":"So there is three more years? So if in fact you are correct that they were under a misapprehension on this matter, then the thing to do would to be find out if that extra three years had something to do with this erroneous thing of Mr. King? It's surprising to me all of this is coming up now, but there we are. So but that's your specific claim."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":10,"text":"I thought it was a different claim. I thought you were claiming there was a violation of due process because an investigator spoke without you present to the board."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":10,"text":"And that I would think was not a violation of the Constitution since it happens every day of the week in administrative agencies. But if you want to claim it is, I'll be happy to listen. And I think in that you're saying the Administrative Procedures Act is unconstitutional, which would be a surprising claim to me."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":10,"text":"Thank you."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"text":"Thank you, counsel. Ms. Mahoney, you have four minutes remaining. "},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":5,"text":"I thought it had some State claims as pendant claims."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":10,"text":"Was there anything at the trial that came out that the investigator when they were in the private session said a fact about Bart King of supreme importance that they didn't know about?"},{"name":"JUSTICE STEVENS","id":7,"text":"Well, didn't one of the decisionmakers testify that they relied on this - -"},{"name":"JUSTICE STEVENS","id":7,"text":"No, but one did."},{"name":"JUSTICE STEVENS","id":7,"text":"And did not the district court find that his testimony was credible?"},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"text":"Thank you, counsel.
