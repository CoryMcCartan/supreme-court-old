The circuit below  said this is not a case where there is an independent sovereign issue governing the U.S. activities.  Just explain to me what's the rationale that would permit a trustee of a trust fund to withhold from the beneficiary the kinds of documents that relate to the management of the fund?

So what you're, it seems to me, you're arguing is there is no duty.

Reading the statute, it says you have to make all inter- agency or all memos available of a certain type, which I think this would fall into.
