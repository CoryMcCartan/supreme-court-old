But if the government had known he's not going for 2 years, he is only going for a year and a half or a year, the agreement might not have been concluded.

The judge can do that at the time when the sentence is imposed. We roll the clock back on the crack -- on the crack cocaine guidelines. Under the authority that judges now have under Booker and Fanfan, a judge could say, well, I see that this is the crack cocaine guideline right now, but I think it is too harsh for all the reasons that were later persuasive in lowering the range, and therefore, I am sentencing below the range. So it seems to lead logically to the conclusion that 3582 is yet another provision of the Sentencing Reform Act that was tied to the old pre-Booker mandatory sentencing regime, and now that that is out the window with Booker and Fanfan, the whole -- the whole mechanism is -- is superfluous."},{"name":"JUSTICE ALITO","id":3,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Well, I find it hard to -- I find it hard to understand the analysis that would require courts to decide whether some (c)(1)(C) plea agreements are based on the guidelines and some are not based on the guidelines.

Because even a C agreement has to be approved by the judge. The legal consequence is not the agreement. That doesn't sentence the defendant. It is the judge's decision as to what the sentence should be which he denotes in accepting the agreement that binds. And I think -- I may be making Justice Breyer's argument -- that if under the policy statement and it's clear what the judge did here, if the judge feels bound by the agreement or otherwise to calculate a sentence in the guidelines and impose one in the guidelines, how can you say that the legal effect is not the guideline sentence?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":5,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"-- no.

If he had calculated the guidelines and if it turned out that the guidelines called for 240 to 360, he could have said easily no, that is so far outside of the guideline range with no justification that I am not going to accept -- impose the sentence. You could withdraw your agreement and do whatever you're going to do."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":4,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"I am not following that argument for this reason. It seems to me if you ask what did the judge apply at the time he imposed the original sentence, well, it has got to be the guidelines, because first the agreement provides for it; then he says I am going to wait for the probation report so I can see what the calculation is, whether I agree with it; and then he gives him a sentence that is precisely within the guidelines. So if you asked me to describe what that sentence was -- of what was it, 46 to 106 days -- I say that was a guideline sentence. It was right there within the brackets that -- the guidelines. So why wasn't it a guideline sentence?"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":4,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"I thought one of the things in the plea agreement was that the -- that the judge would have the right to himself calculate the guideline range."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Thank you, Mr. Gannon.
