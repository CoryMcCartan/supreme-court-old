There are often disputed facts.  But suppose the issue is whether or not this right -- and maybe there are two rights here -- this right was clearly established.  That's -- that's an issue of law."},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"And doesn't that fall within the \"except\" clause that the Chief Justice was talking to you about, which you haven't had much time to fill out, I understand. But -- well, if you're going to say -- and it's really not whether the summary judgment is -- is appealed.  That's a little bit -- it's whether or not the issues resolved by the summary judgment motion are appealable.  I read into your response, or implied from your response, what the Chief Justice did, that maybe sometimes the summary judgment motion, say, on an issue of law is sufficient to preserve the issue."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"So Mr. Mills, what then is the difference?  You point out, quite rightly, summary judgment looks to what evidence there was, and the question for the court is:  What could the plaintiff prove?  When we get past trial, the issue becomes:  What has the plaintiff proved?  So, what was brought out at trial?  What was the record at trial that was larger than the record at summary judgment?  Because if there -- if there was no -- no new fact presentation, no more ample fact presentation, then it wouldn't matter.  It would be the same body of evidence, right?"},{"name":"JUSTICE ALITO","id":5,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Well, this gets to what troubles me about this case.  Although the Sixth Circuit  referred to summary judgment in its opinion, it seems to me the Sixth Circuit actually reviewed the evidence at trial and determined that the defendants were entitled to judgment as a matter of law based on the evidence at trial. So I don't know why this case actually presents the question on which cert was granted.  It seems to me it presents a question of -- a purely factual question in the end, whether there was -- whether judgment as a matter of law was appropriate. And you never raised the judgment as a matter of law. You never raised in the court of appeals, as I understand it, the argument that the defendants' ability to object to the entry of judgment as a matter of law was waived because they never filed a Rule 50(b) motion.  Isn't that right?"},{"name":"JUSTICE ALITO","id":5,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Well, suppose we were to hold that they -- that they couldn't review the denial of summary judgment.  The case is remanded to them, and they say:  Okay, well, we made a slip of the pen when we referred to summary judgment in the prior decision.  We really were saying that the defendants were entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and, although there wasn't a Rule 50(b) motion, that was waived because it wasn't raised on appeal. So we are -- we come back to exactly where we are now.  All we've done is to correct a slip of the -- what was arguably a slip of the pen, perhaps motivated by their belief that the Rule 50(b) issue is jurisdictional.  But it really is not under our cases distinguishing between jurisdictional questions and claims processing questions."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":6,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"But that's not the point that you've made here.

You concede that the Sixth Circuit opinion is using the record built on the whole trial and that that's a different record from the record that existed at summary judgment; is that correct?"},{"name":"JUSTICE KAGAN","id":7,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"So they have that first  paragraph where they suggest that they're ruling on a summary judgment motion.  Then they go through an entire opinion that talks about the facts and the record.  And there are very few citations, but your understanding is that when they talk about the facts in the records, they're talking about the post-trial -- I mean the record that has been built up as a result of the trial?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":8,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"That -- that answer is not addressing Justice Alito's point, which he said a Rule 50 motion is not jurisdictional.  You are in essence claiming it is.  You're saying they lacked the power, but Justice Alito's question to you said they don't, that they've misread the fact that this is not a jurisdictional motion.  So address that question:  Why is it jurisdictional as opposed to a claim processing?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":8,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"The claim processing rules, we have said that, unless you object, the court  doesn't lack power.  Since you didn't object below to a -- a argument that Rule 50(b) precluded consideration by the court of appeals, why wasn't that argument waived before the court?"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Why is it -- I mean, power -- jurisdiction is power, power to proceed in a case.  But we are in an area where there are many, many cases of this Court that distinguish the Rule 50(a), 50(b) from the run-of-the-mine claim processing rule because in the background is the Seventh Amendment Re-examination Clause.  That's the whole reason why there is this 50(a)-50(b) litany, why the verdict loser must repeat the 50(a) motion, after -- after the verdict. So I'm surprised that you're using the word \"power.\" You're not referring to any of that history which stems from a constitutional provision, the Seventh Amendment."},{"name":"JUSTICE ALITO","id":5,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Well, Mr. Mills, I got you started on this, but this -- none of this is the question on which we granted review, is it?"},{"name":"JUSTICE ALITO","id":5,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"We didn't grant review to decide whether a court of appeals can consider judgment of a -- judgment as a matter of law where there isn't a 50(b) motion and no argument is made that the -- that issue was waived by failing to make the motion.  We didn't grant review on that."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"What -- are you saying then that if we explain to the Fifth Circuit -- to the Sixth Circuit, that the record they must look at is the trial record, so it's different from the summary judgment stage, if we told them that, then maybe they would look at the evidence differently, even though they purported to look at the trial evidence?"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"So, if you're right, then there has to be a remand to the Sixth Circuit with instructions to send the case back to the district court to ask the district court what -- whether it thought the evidence was sufficient?"},{"name":"JUSTICE ALITO","id":5,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"And your argument is that where a --the district court denies summary judgment on a qualified immunity issue that is based even purely on an issue of law, there can't be a review unless that's renewed -- there can't be appellate review unless that purely legal question is renewed in a Rule 50(b) motion. That's your -- that's your argument?"},{"name":"JUSTICE ALITO","id":5,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"But what if the facts are utterly undisputed?  There's a videotape of exactly what went on.  Nobody has the slightest disagreement about the facts.  The only question is whether the right was clearly established, and the district court rejects that at summary judgment.  What benefit -- what is the point of saying that the defendants have to raise that same  issue again in a Rule 50(b) motion?  It's utterly a -- a pointless exercise."},{"name":"JUSTICE KAGAN","id":7,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Mr. Mills, when -- when Unitherm talks about the district court feeling the case and having a feel for the case, it's talking about having the feel for the evidence and for the facts.  The whole rationale of Unitherm is based on the evidence, the facts, not on purely legal questions. So suppose we disagree with you about the reach of Unitherm.  Suppose we say Unitherm doesn't have any application to purely legal questions.  What would that mean for your case?  Which part of your claims were purely legal and which part were instead founded on the facts, in which case you would have a better Unitherm argument?"},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"I don't understand, counsel, how your argument -- that in every case you need to know the facts, every qualified immunity case you need to know the facts, and those only come out after trial -- is consistent with our recognizing that you can have a collateral order appeals denial of summary judgment.  In other words, you can consider qualified immunity without knowing how the facts are going to come out at trial, which is why we allow you to have an appeal before trial."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Well -- so you're just saying your case on qualified immunity isn't like that case; is that all?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":6,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"No, it doesn't.

Now, what you want us to do is take that difficulty and continue it on in terms of when you can appeal and when you can't. Some qualified immunity claims are purely legal.  Some are purely factual.  Some are in the middle.  Wouldn't it be easier if we just said:  Here's the rule from now on; you've got to renew them all in a 50(b) motion.  And that makes it a lot easier for the trial courts and the appellate courts to figure out when they have to -- when they can consider it and when they can't.

It would work perfectly. But apparently there's a Second Circuit case, and some things in the treatises, that says sometimes Rule 50(a) is being used for some other purpose.  And that's what seems to be going wrong.  Like if you have a pure question of law, you ought to be outside 50(a); you ought to be doing some other thing. You know, a question like:  Was there collateral estoppel that means that he couldn't say he was a policeman because they litigated this 4 months ago? That's a pure question of law.

I think it applies to the absolute rule of law as well."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":8,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Is that bad?  That's what Justice -- the Chief Justice asked you earlier. Why is that such a horrible thing?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":8,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"You -- I'm -- I'm not sure that answers the question. Isn't it better for the court of appeals to know a district court's opinion on every issue that's going to come up on appeal?  And wouldn't our announcement of a rule -- that whether it's an issue of law or fact, it has to be renewed under 50(b), so  everybody's on the same page as to what's going to be heard on appeal -- why is that a bad rule?  Why would that be a bad outcome as a matter of law?"},{"name":"JUSTICE ALITO","id":5,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"I mean, the answer is it's a -- it's a pointless gotcha rule.  That's -- that's -- isn't that the answer?  It's a pure issue of law, and the district court has already said:  I ruled on this on summary judgment; don't bother me with this again.  And we're going to say, well, you still have to raise it in a 50(b) motion?  What -- that'd be -- that's -- that there's no point.  We might as well say that the lawyer has to stand on his head when the motion is made or jump up and down three times."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":6,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"The point would be that, therefore, you don't have to sort out whether there -- there is any factual content to this issue.  You don't have to sort out what's a pure question of law and what is a mixed question of law and fact, which is always  very difficult.  What's the big deal?  Make the motion."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":4,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"The -- the purpose of 50(b) -- Justice Alito brought out that it's not simply the historical background of the Seventh Amendment, but in that same line of cases, the Court gave a practical reason.  And the practical reason related to the district court, that if the motion is made after the jury comes in, the district judge would have the opportunity to exercise her discretion to grant a new trial. Let's take -- is it Ms. Bright -- where the Sixth Circuit said that, well, maybe there could have been a retaliation claim, but the plaintiff didn't make it.  The district judge, given the chance, might have said:  I would exercise my discretion to allow the plaintiff to have a new trial on this retaliation claim. I thought it was before -- before the court and it was a good claim.  The Sixth Circuit thought it wasn't. I mean, the purpose is to get the district judge into the picture to exercise the district judge's discretion on the very question."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":9,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Your case, anyway, is a case, judging from what they wrote, which -- I'm back to where I started -- the mixed questions and the fact-based questions are you really have to renew your motion.  And reading your opinion, it seems to me it's filled with determinations of fact.  They're reviewing what the jury did and could have found, and on the basis of what they could have found, they say you're not entitled to -- or you are entitled to qualified immunity. So this would seem like a hornbook case where you have to make the motion, and if you have to make the motion, you didn't; and if you didn't, you don't go back and review the facts as the motion on the basis of the facts as they were before the trial.  End  of matter.  What's wrong with that?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":9,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"No, no.  I mean they went on the jury's resolution of the facts."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":9,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"For that reason, they can't take the facts as they were in your motion for summary judgment.
