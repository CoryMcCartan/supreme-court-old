I'm -- I'm not up to everything in the field, but I know there's an existence of something called a per se rule, let's price fix it. I know there's a rule of reason, and I know there's a sort of vague area that sometimes in some cases that Justice Souter mentioned in California Dental, there is something slightly in between, which as I saw those cases, they're very much like price fixing or -- or agreements not to enter. And what they seem to say is, Judge, pay attention to the department when it says that these are very often can be anticompetitive, and ask the defendant why he's doing it. I mean, is that what you want us to say?  It didn't seem as if in your briefs as if you were.  Either you were asking us to produce some kind of structure –- I don't mean to be pejorative, but it's rigid -- a whole set of complex per se burden of proof rules that I have never seen in other antitrust cases, I -- my question is, when I say I've never seen anything like this before in terms of procedure, I want you to refer me to a case that will show, oh, no, I'm out of date."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":6,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"And are there others?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":6,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Is there any other?

Yes, sometimes there are business justifications, so Judge, keep that in mind.  Ask him why he has this agreement, ask him what his justification is, and see if there's a less restrictive alternative.

Are there anticompetitive effects? I have 32 briefs here that explain very clearly what you said in a sentence.  It may be that they're simply dividing the monopoly profit.  I understand that -- you know, I can take that in and so can every judge in the country.  And what's complicated about that. And then I have some very nice dark green briefs that clearly say, four instances, maybe five, where there would be offsetting justifications.  I think they can get that, too."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":6,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"And they mention at least two others.  The first one they mention is because the person's already in the market thinks that the next year or two or three years is worth $100 million a year, and the person who's suing thinks it's worth 30 million a year.  And so he says, hey, I have a great idea, I'll give him the 30 million and keep the 70.  And -- and that, I don't see why that's anticompetitive if that's what's going on. And the second instance they bring up is that it's very hard to break into a market.  So for the new generic to come in, he's thinking, giving me two years isn't worth much because I'll spend a lot of money, it's very hard for me to do it.  But the defendant -- the defendant who wants this patent kept intact says, I will not only let -- I'll let you in a year earlier and I'll give you enough money so that you can start up a distribution system.  The second seems procompetitive, the first, neutral. The problem of deciding whether other matters are or are not really payments for something else, a true nightmare when you start talking about five drugs and different distribution systems and the matter of whether you're paying for litigation costs, a matter of great debate for the judge.  Okay, that's the arguments that they make.  Go ahead."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":7,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Mr. Stewart, can we go back to Justice Breyer's question -- initial question. It's rare that we find a per se antitrust violation. Most situations we put it into rule of reason. You seem to be arguing that this is price fixing, a reverse payment like price fixing so that it has to fall into something greater than the rule of reason."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":7,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"But why is the rule of reason so bad?  As an -- and that's really my bottom line because you're creating all -- I think that's what Justice Breyer was saying.  I mean, for -- for example, I have difficult under -- understanding why the mere existence of a reverse payment is presumptively gives -- changes the burden from the Plaintiff. It would seem to me that you’d have to bear the burden -- the burden of proving that the payment for services or the value given was too high.  I don't know why it has to shift to the other side."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":7,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"So answer the more fundamental question, why is the rule of reason so bad?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":6,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"No.  No.  I mean, Professor Areeda, who is at least in my mind a minor deity in the matter, in this area, if not major, he explains it.  He says don't try for more precision than you can get. The quality of proof required should vary with the circumstances. Do you know how long it took -- I mean, and I -- of course, I -- I know a little bit of antitrust. But I mean, I think -- do you know how long it takes to take in your basic argument that these sometimes can be a division of profit, monopoly profit?  It takes probably 3 minutes or less.  And judges can do that. So you say to the judge, Judge, this is what's relevant here.  And there's a rule of evidence, don't waste the jury's time. So -- so you shape the case as -- and this is what goes -- used to go on for 40 years.  You shape the case in light of the considerations that are actually relevant, useful, and provable in respect to that case.  And district judges, that's their job. So -- so what -- I'm not saying you lose the case. They didn't side with the Eleventh Circuit.  They said there's no violation, okay? I've got your point on that.  But -- but I'm worried about creating some kind of administrative monster."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Thank you, Mr. Stewart.

And then the brand name sends an e-mail back, says -- you know, that seems like a pretty good idea, so I'll give you 25 million. Now, as I understand it, your argument is, I mean, that's just fine.

Suppose -- this sounds like an argument, a discussion that you’d have in the district court, so -- so why -- what's your reaction to this.  Say A, sometimes these settlements can be very anticompetitive, dividing monopoly profit.  In deciding whether anticompetitive outweighs business practices without less restrictive alternatives, judge, you may take that into account.  Two, do not take into account the strength of a patent.  Three, do not try to relitigate the patent. Four, there are several possible justifications, ones I listed before out of the briefs, litigation costs -- the other products, different assessments of -- of value.  Five, there could be, in fact, no anticompetitive effect here because of what you just said now in response to Justice Kennedy and Justice Kagan, but there could be.  We don't know.  Okay? So start with where we were.  Could be anticompetitive.  Give the defense a chance to go through five, one through five, and if they convince you there is a six, we're not saying there isn't, but we can't think of one on the briefs, let them have the sixth, too.  Okay?  Now, judge, weigh and decide. That's what we do.  So we've structured it somewhat to keep the kitchen sink out on the basis of the briefs given to us.

And -- and -- you know, the government is basically saying, we really don't want reverse payments, period.  We want people to settle this the way they should settle it, which is on the strength of the patent.  And that means settling it simply by either paying a royalty for use or settling as most cases do, on an early entry alone, so there's no sharing of -- of -- of profits.  What's so bad about that? I mean, it doesn't deprive either side of the ability to finish the litigation if they want to."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":7,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Well, in the normal course, if the patent's really strong, if you get a year or two earlier entry, that has an inherent value, and that's what you'll pay for is what the government is saying.

I think that's the thrust of Justice Ginsburg's question and it's my concern as well."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":4,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"I thought the government was telling us that that's this case, that the -- what the generic is being offered in the way of sharing the monopoly profits is more than it could ever make if it wanted to and sold its drug."},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":5,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Well, but it's not hypothetical that if the generic wins everybody -- the brand companies’ profits are going to go way, way down right away and generic profits are not going to be that great."},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":5,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Well, but so then the question still holds.
