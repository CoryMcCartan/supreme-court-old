Second, the sentence that the district attorney wanted to give was more than a year greater than the guidelines for manslaughter, and that could have justified it. Now, it writes -- the court then writes in its opinion only the second reason and never mentions the first.  Now, we go to habeas, and the habeas court thinks that second reason is pretty flimsy there.  Gee, she was exposing herself to murder, et cetera, it's pretty flimsy.  The first isn't so bad, but they didn't rely on it.  Okay. So now, what is the habeas court supposed to do?  Is -- should the -- should the defendant have gone back to the State court first?

The quid pro quo was you avoid the possibility of conviction. But here, she's already been convicted.        She had a trial -- you know, by 12 fair, impartial jurors, and she was guilty.  That's -- that's what the jury found.  So it seems to me just as strange to make the prosecution, now that we know she's guilty, submit -- submit that prior offer.

Now, as to that one, what they wrote is the record discloses that the second attorney's advice was set in motion by defendant's statement to the sheriff's deputy that he did not commit the offense. Now, you say that's just contrary to fact as you point to the affidavit.  And the affidavit I read, I think it's a little -- rather ambiguous in that respect, and I can overturn that, or a Federal court can, only if this factual statement I just read you is clearly wrong, Alderson Reporting Company clearly.  So I have a tough time saying it's clearly. And I know they overstated because they said automatically, and thatâ€™s good -- well, that may be an overstatement.  You have to read it in light of that sentence.  But then you're making a second argument, I take it, if this is right.  Your second argument is, anyway, he was incompetent for a completely different reason. He didn't read the record.        And if he'd read it, he never would have made the statement that this is just a manslaughter case.  He would have seen that, if she withdrew her guilty plea, she'd be tried for murder, and then she'd get a really long sentence. So that's an ineffective assistance of counsel.  Now, what does the court in Michigan say about that?  Nothing.  Nothing.  So now, I wonder.  Maybe nobody made that argument to them, or maybe they made it, and they rejected it sub silentio.  That's why I asked my first question.  Okay?  So -- and you heard the response. Even if they had heard that argument and they said nothing about it, they don't have to -- they don't have to mention every argument made.  If they just deny, we assume they deny it, and what we do is see whether they were within their rights to deny it.
