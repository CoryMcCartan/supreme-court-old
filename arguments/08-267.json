But my recollection was that there was no statement, or at least it wasn't quoted in the briefs, to the effect that this is all there is.

Well, then I'm not quite sure I understand your argument. Maybe you can explain why you contend that if the Respondent had been convicted in a Federal district court and everything else was the same, he would be able to petition for a writ of coram nobis, but he can't in the military courts. What is the basis for that? Both a Federal district court -- a Federal district court is a creature of statute. It has the jurisdiction that Congress gives it and no greater jurisdiction.

And I -- I want to follow up with one question on that. As I recall, it was in response to the -- to the Morgan argument. The -- the Morgan analysis was, well, this isn't a -- a new ground or a new assertion. It is jurisdiction as would be the case in habeas. It, in effect, is -- is kind of a metaphysical continuation of the -- the jurisdiction that existed before. And your response to that was, in effect, a Goldsmith response. And -- and you said past jurisdiction doesn't mean present jurisdiction. The past jurisdiction is over, and that's under -- under the statute and under Goldsmith that's -- that's the end of it. Couldn't that same argument simply have been made, however, in -- in Morgan? In other words, Morgan was a case in which the point of finality had been reached. There was no specific statute in Morgan saying there's coram nobis jurisdiction, and yet the Court's analysis -- I -- I called it metaphysical a second ago -- was that this really was simply a continuation of the past jurisdiction. If that was a sound argument in Morgan, why isn't it a sound argument with respect to the -- the military code here?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":7,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"It -- it did do that, and there's -- there is no question that it certainly made finality provisions in Article 76.

They will review after the event the court-martial jurisdiction, the court-martials of people while they were in the military. That will become a matter of course anytime.

But there is one difference. The difference is that often, though not always, a person in habeas who challenges a prior normal, civil system conviction, the State can retry him; and I guess in the instance that we're talking about, he can never be retried. So in fact the difference would be, in your view, the civilians who bring this would never be retried if they're right."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":9,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"And so they would have in that sense greater protection in the military system than in the ordinary criminal courts a person has in habeas, because the option of retrial is often but not always there.

In this case they decide whether the guy stays in the country or is deported."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Well, so I think Justice Breyer's question is still on the table.
