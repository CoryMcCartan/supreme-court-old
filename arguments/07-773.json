The agreement says you've got to arbitrate.

It came from the court. The courts said, no, we won't enforce arbitration agreements if it would oust us of jurisdiction. Why would a court reading section 2 not say, well, that rule never made any sense in the first place, so we're not going to follow it? It's not any rule that Congress has imposed on the courts."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"That may have been the historic model. This was never a notion that Congress enforced on the courts. They imposed it on themselves. So my question remains why shouldn't the Court then say this agreement has been declared enforceable, the ouster doctrine didn't have much to recommend it in the beginning, but certainly not any more; we can change it?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"I'm just not getting the -- I have never understood this argument and I still don't understand it now. What is it in the text of section 2 that would seem to leave it inadequate to touch equity as well as law?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Exactly. And why, therefore, would anyone -- why would anyone be drawing distinctions as to how? It would be enforceable in any way that an agreement might appropriately be enforced in the courts of the United States at the time -- or any courts, for that matter, at the time the act was passed."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"It -- it made a categorical statement in section 2.

It says they will be irrevocable and enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract. Obviously this -- this section was meant to apply to equitable actions. You wouldn't dismiss them in law for a -- a ground that only existed in equity?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":5,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"I don't know.

You look at their underlying dispute, the underlying one, and you say: Is there diversity? What's the problem?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":8,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Why -- why wouldn't you do just what I said, just what we started with? You take out the arbitration agreement, and then you look to see what this dispute is about. And if it's about something that happens to involve all people from one side in one State and from another State on the other side, there is jurisdiction. Why is that a problem? I don't understand."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":8,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Why?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":8,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Why?"},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":9,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"All right. So you define \"look through\" as -- under our hypothetical here as looking through to all people who might potentially be parties under this arbitration agreement."},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":9,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"I will think about that. I'm -- I'm -- I wasn't -- it wasn't clear to me that that was so."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Can I hold up just a second to make sure I understand it. You are saying that, let's say, Person A has an arbitration agreement that implicates Persons B and C. C is diverse, but B is not. They could decide to compel arbitration with respect to B and leave C out of it. But if you follow the look-through doctrine, you would say, well, the dispute is between A and B and C; and so you would be depriving A of their right to frame their own complaint in a way that doesn't create Federal jurisdiction."},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":9,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"But that's not quite so, because the -- the action could proceed with just A and C, and then it -- it could come to a complete judgment as to them. In the look through for the -- the claims that are involved, the action couldn't possibly proceed without taking account of the pre-emption claim that the Federal -- the Federal claim. You couldn't -- you could decide the case completely in No. 1, the diversity case, but not in No. So there -- so there is a difference. It's true, you don't decide it completely as to all parties."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Of course, I suppose how that works depends on what the rules are about how you frame the dispute once you do look through. I mean, if there is a pending State suit between A and B, even though C may -- you could have sued C as well, I mean the judge can say, well, I am only going to look through to what the -- the actual litigation is; and if I look at that, that's not a Federal case. And -- and -- and so your position follows."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Yes, and what really leapt off the page at me in that opinion, he gets to the end, I think he basically presents your position and then he says: Thus, on my reading the relevant portion of section 4 could be rewritten this way. Well, I mean that to me is a confession of error if you have to rewrite the statute to get to your position."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Well, his rewriting doesn't look very much like section 4 to me."},{"name":"JUSTICE ALITO","id":7,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"What about the fact that that was not included in the New Jersey statute, nor was it included in -- was it included in the Uniform Arbitration Act?"},{"name":"JUSTICE ALITO","id":7,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"What's the explanation for that?"},{"name":"JUSTICE ALITO","id":7,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"I know.

"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":3,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"But that's the question that I have, Mr. Phillips. What is the underlying dispute between the parties? It seems to me that your look-through argument is look-through only halfway. That is, if you look -- if you consider the controversy, the suit that was brought in the State court, the controversy is here we have a customer who hasn't paid the amount charged. So we have a suit on a debt. Why isn't that the controversy? You have to make the counterclaim the controversy, which comes up only defensively. It wasn't brought as a lawsuit."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Who gets to frame - - who gets to frame the complaint? Normally if you're a party and you have a dispute that may implicate Federal law, you have control over the complaint. You don't have to have a -- you don't have to well plead it in a way that implicates a Federal question. You can go out of your way to do it in a way that does not implicate a Federal question; and therefore it would not be, you could not bring it in Federal court. Just as in the diversity example, you can specifically avoid suing people who would create diversity. But in your position the judge has to in his mind write a complaint and see whether there is jurisdiction or not; and how does the judge decide whether to sue diverse parties or not to sue diverse parties?"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":3,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"But -- but she chose to assert it only defensively; and it's not a complaint - - the counterclaim if it had been brought as an independent action, everybody agrees qualifies for Federal jurisdiction. But the litigant who has this claim is asserting it only as a defense to a claim that you admit does not qualify for Federal jurisdiction."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":3,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"But in the practical effect, what happens? Now you have asserted that you can enforce because of the counterclaim that asserts - - that arises under Federal law. But you say it's is not the same as removal because the underlying claim, your suit on the debt owed, remains in Federal -- State court; but what happens to that claim once you have this arbitration?"},{"name":"JUSTICE STEVENS","id":6,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Mr. Phillips - -"},{"name":"JUSTICE STEVENS","id":6,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Clear up one thing for me.
