We are talking about constitutional power.  So if we start out with the example of registration for life being imposed as part of supervised release, part of the criminal sentence, then we go to an example where it is not part of thePage 29 criminal sentence, but it is a civil requirement triggered by a separate civil proceeding for every Federal -- every person convicted of a sex offense under Federal law. Now, if that were the setup statutorily, would that fall within Congress's power under Article 1?"},{"name":"JUSTICE ALITO","id":5,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Well, we know what -- and we know what power they are relying on.  Let's just look at the power that they're relying on here.  It's the power to make rules for the regulation of the military.  So part of their -- in the exercise of their power to make rules for the regulation of the military, they impose a civil sex offender registration requirement for someone convicted of a sex offense under the Uniform Code of Military Justice.  That does not, in your judgment, fall within Article I?"},{"name":"JUSTICE KAGAN","id":7,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"How about if he is on supervised release?

Then why not this?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":9,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Well -- why not?  I mean, look, this is -- Thomas Reed Powell once said, \"If you can think of a thing that is inextricably related to another thing without thinking of the other thing, then you have the legal mind,\" and that seems to be this case.  All right?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":9,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"So somehow I have to get out of my mind the ex post facto part, the potential violation of due process part, the equal protection part, take that aside.  Now I've got to just think about whether it has, Congress has the power under the provision that Justice Alito said.  I'm trying to doPage 31 that, and I've dissented in other cases on other grounds. All right.  But in -- in just trying to do that, I think, well, the military, suppose they found a certain number of -- of individuals, men or women, have unfortunate problems in the military.  They discover there is a mental illness problem.  The person's out of the military.  But the law says you can go and tell the local mental health authorities about this person even though he's no longer there. And suppose the person had a criminal problem in the military and was in prison and suppose the law said, you know, you're the ones who got the situation where he unfortunately got into that problem, and you, later on, can -- can go and tell authorities about his problems so they can take appropriate action. Now, if they can do that, why can't they have the power under Article I to say really, you all have to register.  Now, maybe there are other things, but you got this problem in the military.  You were convicted in the military.  You did it in the military. We turned you loose and there you are, and we want, as part of our military regulation, to be able to tell authorities about you and to make you register according to State law.Page 32 Now, no due process problem, I have to assume that away.  No punishment, bad punishment problem, none of those.  But it's a power, all right? Why not?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":9,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Where you're leading me because I'm not so worried about this case, but where you're leading me is down in Commerce Clause cases and all kinds of other cases.  Suddenly a distinction arises that Congress can, in fact, do all kinds of things having Federal authorities do this and that, but you couldn't make someone in a State -- you know, you can imagine a few that are coming into my mind -- and so what I'm worried about is following this distinction into other areas."},{"name":"JUSTICE ALITO","id":5,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Well, let me -- let me try this chain of reasoning out on you and -- and get your reaction.  We're starting out with the power of Congress to make rules for the regulation of the military.  And one of the things that they want to do in making those rules is to make military installations acceptable to the local communities where they are located. They know from experience, for example, what's happened in Okinawa, that when have you military personnel who go -- who commit sex offenses with people off base, it can cause tremendous opposition.  And this is what happened here, not the opposition, but an offense involving a 15-year-old girl who lived off the base. So in order to ensure that there -- we don't have excessive civilian opposition to the location ofPage 34 military bases, we are going to do a number of things. One thing is we're going to criminally prosecute members of the military who commit these offenses.  This will deter.  This will incapacitate.  But also, to provide further assurance to the community that these people are not going to be dangerous, we are going to require them to register. Now, maybe that's too attenuated, but I'd like to get your reaction.  Why could Congress not do that under the Necessary and Proper Clause?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":4,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"You don't have to go that far though to -- to distinguish the example that Justice Alito just gave.  This is not a statute which only requires him to registrate -- to register if he hangs around the military installation.  This requires him to register anywhere, you know, in the -- in the wilds of Alaska where -- it's just not this case. And even -- even if you would allow that,Page 35 and say it is a reasonable -- it has a reasonable connection to the power to regulate the military, to say wherever he goes he has to register is -- is a different question, isn't it?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":9,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"But yet, now that's exactly the problem for me because the -- the wilds of Alaska you think I think, and I think I think, that -- that sure, if there's a post office there -- there's a post office there, then what -- the military is all right, they can mail a letter to the -- to be delivered to the local doctor to say, look, he has a problem. That seems to be okay. But you say it's not going to be okay to tell him he has to go and make that registration.  At that point what you've done is like Madison.  I mean, it's an interpretation of the Commerce Clause that I think Madison might have wanted, which is you're reading a lack of power because of a civil rights problem. I mean, it's -- the difference between the two cases is really not the need because we have to assume the need.  The difference is the restriction on the individual.  And it's that part that I'm suddenly worried about the Commerce Clause and every power in Article I being read with exceptions in the civil rightsPage 36 area even though we have the amendments to protect the civil rights problems."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":4,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"We've never -- we've never held, have we, that what the Federal government can itself do under the Necessary and Proper Clause it can impose upon individuals to do under the Necessary and Proper Clause.
