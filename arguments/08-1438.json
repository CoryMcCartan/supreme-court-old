It's not -- doesn't say in the Spending Clause legislation that we open up our treasury."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":5,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"The word \"appropriate\" -- the word \"appropriate\" would -- would suggest that to me. If -- if I'm a State attorney general, and I -- I know that the rule is sovereign immunity and -- and especially with regard to raids on the State treasury, I think it would be at least plausible that I would -- I would read \"appropriate relief\" not to include monetary relief. And we have said -- the language from our cases -- Lane says a waiver of sovereign immunity must be unequivocally expressed in the statutory text and will be strictly construed in terms of its scope in favor of the sovereign. That's -- that's a high test."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":5,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"And -- and although I might sit down and come out with a conclusion after intensive study that yes, maybe the best reading of this statute is that it allows money damages, I find it hard to say that it is unequivocally expressed in the statutory text."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":5,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"You -- you deny that it has to be unequivocal?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":6,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"But that has nothing to do with whether the language is clear or not to constitute a waiver.

Am I remembering that correctly?"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":4,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"But then you're bracketing the State with counties and municipalities. It really comes down to a question -- who decides whether the state fisc is touched. And why isn't it most appropriate for this Court to say, Congress can call it either way, but our rule is, Congress, if you want to reach the State treasury, you have to say so explicitly. And then there is no doubt when the State enters a contract that it's going to be subject to money damages as well as injunctive relief."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Thank you, counsel."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Mr. Ho.

I think you might say that there are a lot of cases which interpret the word \"appropriate relief\" to include monetary relief. And then there is some that don't. And to get a rule out of them, you would have to say, well, they are looking to context. And in context it sometimes is clear, sometimes occasionally not. But here, isn't this and maybe this was asked, but I want your answer. The context here, the words appropriate relief, govern both the prison situation and the land use situation, don't they? You are given an action when the government through a general land use regulation infringes somebody's right to build, for example. Now, wouldn't that kind of interference with the use of property quite often and normally require some kind of monetary compensation? This isn't just the odd thing in a prison, where it's talking about it might be called building a religious building or building some kind of parking, all kinds of things that have monetary compensation. Do you see my question?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":9,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"I know, but isn't it the same word that governs both?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":9,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"If it's the same word that governs both and if land cases very often involve claims for money, I would think that would cut against you. But that's why I ask. I want to get your response."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":9,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"But there are loads of cases that have nothing more than appropriate relief and in those cases context makes it clear.

And it turns out that that land restriction violates this statute. And in the meantime they have had to rent buildings, they have had to maybe build somewhere else and they have had to do all kinds of things that cost money. And that's why I would think in that context money would be a natural thing."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":9,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"To fulfill appropriateness."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":4,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"I thought a local government would be subject to damages. We are talking about the state."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":6,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"So now we have three distinctions. With respect to land use discrimination, the Rehab Act would presumably apply. So the Rehab Act says compensatory damages are permissible for that kind of discriminatory claim, so now we have compensatory damages for that. We have, potentially, compensatory damages for local governments, but not for State or Federal level. We are chopping up the statute at each stage, correct? We are treating different defendants differently and different claims differently with respect to the relief that's permissible?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":6,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Could you explain why?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":6,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"But equity permits money as well.

As I understand it, there are some cases that find the words \"appropriate relief\" in a statute to include damages and there's some that don't. Let's look at the ones that don't. There is some where it's pretty hard to do it because it's in a heading called \"injunction,\" and that's obvious. But there are only two statutes, really, where the courts have ever held in significant numbers that the word \"appropriate relief\" does not include money damages.

And -- and you might want to say that the Spending Clause is potentially so sweeping that the State should have special protection and we should be particularly careful about the clear statement rule.
