If you're just looking at a particular case, you have no idea whether 5 years is reasonable or not. There has to be a background to it so that you know that in this type of case, people usually get a sentence of 3 years or they usually get a sentence of 10 years. And it seems to me that what's ordinary is going to be a judge -- a driving fact in determining what's reasonable."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Even if you're looking at not just the number, but the reasons. In other words, the question I asked earlier, you've got nine district judges, they all say we do not depart downward for military service, and you've got one district judge that says we do. It seems to me that if the court of appeals can't review that to bring about some uniformity in the factors that are appropriate to consider, then it's essentially a lawless system."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"On my particular case, what's the right answer for the court of appeals? They've got two cases before them. One, the judge departs three years because of military service. The prosecutor appeals. The other, the judge refuses to depart because of military service and the defendant appeals. Should those -- what should happen with those two cases?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":6,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Where does that come from as a matter of law? That is, suppose -- now you can say I -- if you want, say my hypothesis is wrong, but if I start with an assumption that Congress did want the court of appeals to try to create greater uniformity in sentencing, and it wanted cooperation between the courts of appeals and the sentencing commission, indeed the sentencing commission itself is an effort to copy a system that exists in Britain where courts of appeals create a degree of uniformity. Suppose I start with that assumption and say that's what the guidelines were about and the reason that number 4 is in 3553, it's not just one factor among many. After all, it was attached to a bill that was the guideline bill. And indeed, the part we excised was a floor amendment that came along later to make it even tougher. So if I start with the assumption that's what Congress wanted, not what I wanted, Congress wanted it, now is there something in the Constitution that forbids it? That's where I start -- I am starting personally with that question in mind, always, if this is what Congress wanted, we should try to do it unless there's something in the Constitution that forbids it. And is there something in the Constitution that would forbid the court of appeals to do what on page 91 they did here, leaving the word extraordinary out of it? Now, just going through the different elements of this case and coming to the conclusion that what the district judge did was unreasonable?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":6,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"It's not mandatory. It says the district, the court of appeals judge says, now, let's think here. We have 8 -- 7 people on the sentencing commission that have really looked into that. And they think that in an ordinary course with this small amount of drugs, the person ought to get so many months. That reflects a lot of thought. Seems reasonable to us. And here the district judge is giving him half that or 40 percent of that without a good reason that we can find. The judge said he did it because it was just one little episode and we think there were many episodes. And that's basically their reason. Now, now -- what -- the Sixth Amendment forbids that?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":6,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Yeah - -"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":7,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Aren't you really saying that the most weight that the guidelines can be given, or guidelines can be -- is that -- I apologize for my voice -- the most weight the guidelines can be given is, is the weight of necessary advertence? The guidelines, in effect, are at odds with the rest of 3553(a). The rest of them say individualized sentencing. The guidelines, in effect, says, no, sentencing by the guidelines. Therefore, in order to -- to break this, in effect, logical incommensurateness, on your view, I think the most that you can concede is that before a district judge sentences finally, he must show that he has considered the value of uniformity as something different from individualized sentencing, but that's as much as he can be required to do. Is that a fair statement of your position?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":7,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Yes. I -- I stand corrected here. I'm sorry."},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Well, as one of the themes that you advance, you indicate that if your approach is followed that the guidelines will then be adjusted over time. I assume they would be adjusted to be more precise, but then we are right back where we started because you want to give the guidelines very little effect. It seems to me, in a way, you're arguing against yourself. If your view is accepted and the result is considerable disparity, I suppose all that Congress can do is have mandatory minimums."},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Do you think it is idle to talk about disparity before the Sentencing Reform Act was adopted? You remember those days."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":6,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Yeah, yeah. But there - - you know, we can go back into that, but there was a whole history that people testified, tremendously, no opposition, virtually none, that you needed a judge wheel. Why do you need a judge wheel in New York if, in fact, the sentence didn't depend on the personality of the judge? And why did you get different sentences across the country which I don't -- I've never heard a possibility of explaining that the judges didn't understand what the parole commission was like. That's a different issue. So what -- what I'm concerned about is if we followed your position literally, what we're saying is that the Constitution of the United States prevents any effort to create uniform sentences throughout the country for people who different judges -- God doesn't tell us what the right sentence is. We don't know. There are reasonable sentences within a vast, vast range of possible sentences. And you're saying we have to go back to that. And that wasn't -- I'm looking, in other words, for you to tell me something that says we don't have to be back to that, but we don't have to make it that rigid either. And that's what I'm looking for, to be honest with you, and I haven't -- I'm not certain I get it."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Could you describe it again?

That is, one as in this case might think as she expressed it, to sentence him to more than 15 months would throw away his life. Another might say it's -- it's unreal to assume that he just sold 23 grams of crack when he admitted that he had been out on that same street every night for two and a half weeks. So the quantity is much larger. And he was in that sense a repeater, so I'm going to sentence him to at least the bottom of the guidelines, nothing less. Those could be reasonable determinations, two different reactions that judges would have to the same set of facts."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":8,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"In any case, you -- you, you are not driven to the alternative that Justice Breyer suggests, that there is no way to achieve absolute uniformity. It's very easy. It was what the dissenters in the Booker remedial phase urged, which is use facts found by the jury and you can have the sentences as rigid as you like. It is really only, only when you want to let the facts be found by the judge that you come into the difficulty that, that we're arguing about. But it's certainly not decreed by logic or by heaven that there is no way to achieve determinate sentencing. There certainly is."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":6,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Do you agree? Because I think that system would, in fact, give total sentencing power to the prosecutor, who would determine the sentence by the kind and degree of evidence that he introduced and what he charged.

But one of, one of the arguments that was made by defense counsel here was just there was -- there is an irrational disparity between the penalty for crack and the penalty for powdered cocaine. Your predecessor thought that was so wrong, he thought it was unconstitutional. I think at the very least you ought to take into account that if this man were distributing or possessed for distribution powdered cocaine instead of crack, the sentence range, the guideline sentence range would have been six months to a year. Now we know that Congress wanted to retain that disparity. Is a district judge free to say under advisory guidelines, I am going to ignore the difference, I'm going to treat this defendant as though he possessed powdered cocaine?"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Well, specifically, can you take into account, can he say I'm going to treat him as though he possessed powdered cocaine?

Mr. Dreeben. "},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":8,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"As closely as it can, and the \"as it can\" depends upon violation of the Sixth Amendment by entitling defendants to sentences determined by facts found by a judge instead of a jury. Suppose in this case the court of appeals instead of disallowing the lower sentence, approved it? And then in the next case that comes up involving what was the small amount of equivalent, 5.26 grams of cocaine powder rather than crack, okay? Suppose in the next case it would have been 30 grams of powder. And the district court judge once again departs just the way the departure was here, and the court of appeals says no, that departure is unreasonable. You now have circuit law which says 30 grams, you get the guidelines sentence; 5.26 grams, you're entitled to a lesser sentence. Okay? Why isn't -- why haven't we fallen back into the same problem that produced Booker/Fanfan? You have fact findings being made by the judge. It's a judge who decides whether it's 30 grams or 5.26 grams. What difference does it make whether that factual difference produces an entitlement to a sentence on the basis of the guidelines or on the basis of an opinion by or a series of opinion by a court of appeals? Isn't the Sixth Amendment equally violated?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":8,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"But if you have two cases that are in other respects similar, and the court of appeals has held 5.26 is too little to apply the guidelines, it's okay to depart downward the way this judge did, it seems to me that the next case that comes up, the defendant has an entitlement to that lower sentence."},{"name":"JUSTICE STEVENS","id":9,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"May I ask this question: It seems to me that in sentencing there are two different broad categories of decision that the judge has to make, one involving the severity of the crime, and the other the characteristics of the particular offender.

There might be a difference in the"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":6,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"What do you think about taking some of the Rivera ideas -- I'm slightly hypothesizing this -- and following up with what Justice Stevens said. You'd say look, one thing a district judge can't say, he can't say that I believe the guideline is right for a typical case. And I think this is a typical case. And I won't follow the guideline. You couldn't think those three things?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":6,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"So one big power a judge has that they didn't have before, after Booker, is to say the guideline itself is unreasonable. So we're - - let's just say -- and there if they say that, the district judge could decide whether or not, the court of appeals could decide is the guideline reasonable or not reasonable. But leave those cases aside. I imagine they'll be few and far between. Now we take one they assume is reasonable. And now unlike the past, the judge has to do three things. One, to give the kind of thing that -- the reason he's not following the guideline, which he admits is reasonable for a typical case. So what's the kind of thing that leads you to think yours is not typical? And he says it. And then he has the evidence as to the related facts. And then he has the degree of departure. As to the first thing, the court of appeals could review it and decide whether it is or is not the kind of thing. As to the second and third, they also could review it but only after giving considerable weight to what the district judge thinks about the case in front of him. Now maybe that's -- I mean, you might not have a reaction to that.

He doesn't -- does he have to find it's unreasonable? There can certainly be two reasonable sentences; and he's under no obligation to select the guidelines sentence, is he?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":8,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"So he doesn't have to determine that it's unreasonable. I don't think we should approach the discussion as though that's, that's the situation."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":6,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"That's the other thing I'm not certain about, the proportionality, and the reason I'm not certain of it is I'm not certain what it means. That is, it sounds nice, as if you're saying something, but proportional to what? I mean, I can think of two problems. One problem, of course, is that the chart in the guidelines is written on a logarithmic scale and that means that if you move from one level, from 9 to 10, it's 3 months or 2 months; if you move from 29 to 30, it's 2 years. Now, whether you're at 29-30 or whether you're at 9 and 10 might depend upon things that just have nothing to do with your reason for departure. You might have added on something for having a gun and your reason for being lenient might have to do with the person's having a gun. So you're going to say it make a difference whether you were high up or whether you were low down, when your reason for departing has nothing to do with whether you're high up or whether you were low down? You see? It doesn't actually work, I don't think, proportionality review, because it's so hard to say what's proportional."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":6,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Well, why use the word \"proportional,\" because the other thing is what the Chief Justice brought out, is that why is it that if a person has a bad reason, I mean, why should a bad reason justify a little departure rather than a lot?

But I'm trying to figure the point at which he will lose touch with his family, with his work, he will be thrown away. That was the judgment that she made. She tried to make a sentence that would be significant, 15 months, but that would not be so long that it would put him out of touch with his children and his wife and his work.
