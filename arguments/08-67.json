And it's an issue which is - - does not go to the reason we took the case, but I'd like your response to it. Your argument, your Ashe v. Swenson argument, assumes, as you have said in the brief, that the -- that the verdicts of acquittal essentially determined that your client did not possess insider knowledge, and I question whether the verdicts of acquittal did necessarily establish that fact. I've looked at the -- at the jury instructions, and I will be candid to say I did not parse the whole jury instruction, so you may very well correct me in the assumption that I'm going to make. But the point of the -- of the jury instruction that seemed to go to your argument is set out on page 105 of the Joint Appendix, and the judge is telling the jurists what they had to find. And one of them was that your client made any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading as charged. It seems to me that the jury under that instruction could have come back with a verdict of acquittal simply on the assumption that your client had not made affirmative statements at the -- at the meeting in question, therefore he had no obligation to correct any statements, because it is not clear from this instruction that he had to correction the statements of other people who omitted material facts, and that therefore the only thing that the verdict proves or the only thing that the verdict may have assumed is that he didn't speak up and say anything. Is that a possible analysis?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"No, no, I agree that did seem to be the point of the cross-examination, and in fact I guess you set it out in one of the briefs.

To my knowledge, we've never held that that is enough to convert or, let's say, to -- for us to assume, despite a more protean jury instruction, that the jury necessarily had to find a fact.

If I understand your position, the logical analysis is not going to win the case for you because, as I understand the case that we've got in front of us, we have in effect two lines of authority, two models, that describe what the law might be in these circumstances. One model, on -- on the assumption that -- that the acquittals determined what you say they did, on that model there -- there is -- there is an issue preclusion that is raised. On the second model, the model of what we do in the case of a hung jury, there is no -- of course, no preclusion, and there is no bar to a retrial. And we've simply got both in the same case. The question is: Which model do we follow? Do we say preclusion is the most important issue here, or do we say the open-endedness and uncertainty of the hung jury, the - - the failure to reach a verdict, is the model that - - that tells us what we ought to do?

And the answer is, because you're trying him again. And that's why we have all the briefs that we have, because the only way to answer this is to look and see if the policies that underlie the collateral estoppel part of double jeopardy apply here. And I can't think of one that doesn't. I can't think of one single one that wouldn't apply. Maybe there are some.

I thought what it had to do with is that they are being tried at the same time. And to test that out in my mind, I imagine this. In February we try the individual for the drug count, he's acquitted. In June we bring a telephone count. Absolutely forbidden, right?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":8,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Okay. So why should the government be one whit better off because, in addition to doing that, they happened to bring a telephone count in January along with the other?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":3,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"But -- isn't -- isn't the real problem that you raised by your answer the following problem: That in this age in which there are, as Justice Breyer's hypo suggests, lots of overlapping criminal statutes -- you can indict not only for drugs but for telephones, and I don't know what other overlapping crimes there -- there may be. Therefore, that gives the government by joining a lot of overlapping charges or lots of charges with common elements in either one indictment through various counts or simply by a series of indictments to be tried together -- it gives the government a bigger chance of getting a hung jury or some irrational resolution on some of those issues. And if the government can bring loads of counts, increase the likelihood of getting a hung jury on one issue or one indictment, the government in effect has a key to avoiding just what Justice Breyer's hypothetical suggested. If they wait and bring the second count in June, there's an issue preclusion. But if they bring it together, they've got an irrational verdict and there's no issue preclusion. Therefore, isn't the policy behind both double jeopardy and the issue preclusion extension a policy that argues in favor of saying don't let the government have all these bites at the apple, because in fact it results or can result in seriatim prosecutions? What's -- what's your response to that argument?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":3,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"But does the -- does the government ask for something more than one fair chance when it comes in with 117 counts?

It trimmed 5 -- if there were 20 insider trading, on the new indictment, there were 5. There were 99 counts of laundering, which were trimmed to 8, something within the jury's ken.

Now, all that you did to turn that case into a winning case was you also indicted him on the telephone count in January. Now, that was my question the first time, and you began to have two answers. I just didn't see why the government should be any better off because they also indicted him in January. Given the language \"double jeopardy,\" you might think the government, if anything, should be worse off, but let's keep them neutral. So what is the reason that the government should be worse off because they indicted him in January on the telephone count as well as in June?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":8,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"No, no -- better.

Here, however, you can give full effect to the verdict of acquittal without undermining another jury verdict.
