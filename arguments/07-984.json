And then the two agencies come along and in effect they say by regulation, if the suspended solid in effect comes out of a mine, or if the wastewater has got suspended solid in it, we are going to call it \"fill\" and leave it entirely to the Army Engineers under 404, subject to an EPA veto. And on the face of it, it sounds as though they are simply, number one, defining one -- one variant of pollution out of the EPA's jurisdiction, and, number two, with respect to the wastewater, in effect coming up with a contradictory determination about what should be done with it. And it sounds as though, under the Administrative Procedure Act, that with the statutory and the regulatory regime on the one hand and this joint regulation on the other, you've simply got a flat contradiction, and query whether that can be anything other than arbitrary and capricious under the APA.
