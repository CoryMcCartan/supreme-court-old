Wood, written by Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes.  And it seems to me itâ€™s very clearly ties its state analysis to the Federal Constitution and a Sixth Amendment discussion in Wood. So it seems to me that you're -- you have a very strong argument that they did adjudicate the Federal claim anyway.  I know you want us to maybe reach the bigger issue, but -- and your brief almost downplays it -- but it seems to me pretty clear that you have the argument, that you don't strongly make, although you don't, by any means, abandon it, that -- that here the state law was tied to the Federal standard, and the Federal standard was the basis for the entire jurisprudence."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Irrebuttably?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"I see exceptions to that already.

So there really isn't any independent -- Williams hasn't stated any independent Sixth Amendment right.  It's State law was violated and therefore the Constitution was violated. So it seems to me if we just look at the position that Williams was taking, that these two, the State and the Federal claim, are tied -- tied together.

Now, that serves one purpose.  A human being has a hard time writing that unless he's thinking:  I've looked this over pretty carefully.  And if it's a staff attorney preparing a draft, the staff attorney doesn't want to -- doesn't want to write those words unless he or she has really looked with some care. And so it serves a purpose.  It means they don't do it just as a form.  They could turn it into a form, but they shouldn't.

Justice Sotomayor and Justice Alito have given you hypotheticals, very different from this case, but hypotheticals, where there is, I think, a strong inference that there was no adjudication of the particular Federal claim alleged. You said that's not a plain statement, even though it seems as though there is a strong inference. So what would be a plain statement?"},{"name":"JUSTICE KAGAN","id":9,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Yes, I don't know why they would say that either.

I've never seen a procedure like this. And I looked -- I looked at this -- the Federal cases, Brown and Thomas, that the Cleveland court cited.  Those -- and Wood was voir dire, was not mid-jury. I just hope this doesn't happen with much regularity.  And the fact that the trial judge is upset, that's the reason that you should leave the jury alone, it seems to me.

Most of the time when we're assessing bias, we're assessing it on the grounds of extraneous evidence, a juror who has said one thing in voir dire and is now either a convicted felon or introduced extraneous circumstance.

This case is troublesome."},{"name":"JUSTICE KAGAN","id":9,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Could I go back, Ms. Brenan, to your basic theory, because I guess I'm not sure I understand what you're arguing now. In your brief, you talked about focusing on the error.  So if evidence was admitted, you would say it doesn't matter that there were three different theories for why the admission of evidence was wrong; you should just look at the fact that we're talking about the admission of evidence.  Now, is -- is that what you're arguing, or are you also saying what the states say in their amicus brief, that even if, you know, one claim is about the admission of evidence, and one claim is about ineffective assistance of counsel, you would still apply the same rule?"},{"name":"JUSTICE KAGAN","id":9,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Well, why does your theory make any sense?  I mean, we're supposed to be interpreting a statute here that says whether the claim was adjudicated on the merits.  Usually when we speak of claims, we speak of legal grounds for relief.  We don't look at a claim and say, we'll just check, you know, what -- we don't use an operative facts test, and you seem to be suggesting that that's the kind of test we should use."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Thank you, counsel.

It doesn't address the rule that we want to address and was the reason for us taking the case, but 104a, the State court, State appellate court, cites the United States v.

I mean, I think the simplest statement of the State rule is that the State believes that if you remove a juror for actual bias, that that is okay under the Sixth Amendment.  They said it in Cleveland.  They were presented with the argument in this case by the briefing that the juror was not biased and hence the Sixth Amendment was violated.  And they ruled to say he was biased, and I see as a natural, clear inference that they were saying the Sixth Amendment wasn't violated because he was biased."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":3,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"That's a different question.

I mean, it's a -- they're applying Cleveland.  Cleveland is a constitutional decision.  It's a Federal constitutional decision. The concurrence makes that completely clear. California has made it completely clear in other cases post Cleveland that it thinks it's applying the Sixth Amendment. Whether it's applying a correct interpretation of the Sixth Amendment is unclear, but it's also completely irrelevant.  It thinks it's applying the Sixth Amendment, and it's reaching a Constitutional judgment, isn't it?"},{"name":"JUSTICE KAGAN","id":9,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"You're quite right, it does not adopt the consensus standard.  It specifically rejects the consensus standard, but it's entitled to do that.  As a state court, with no Supreme Court decision that it has to follow, it can say, we have a different view of the Sixth Amendment.  I'm just repeating what Justice Alito here said.

More than half of it concerns Federal law. I mean, they don't just cite that Federal case.  They say, \"In assessing whether a juror is impartial for Federal constitutional purposes -- Federal constitutional purposes -- the United States Supreme Court has said,\" da, da, da, then they quote it all.  Now, since your argument, the argument in the -- in this brief here is entirely Sixth Amendment, as far as I can tell, they say, look, look what happened here, they took this man off the jury.  That violates my rights to Sixth Amendment right.  It says it over and over and over.  I have no doubt you raised it. And now they give an answer.

You think the answer to that is clearly no.  The Government thinks it's yes.  And I can understand the differences of opinion, but I'm back to my question.
