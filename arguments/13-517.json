And that's a pretty old rule.  And some people might think it makes no sense.  You can have an eavesdropper, and that's okay, but you can't have a juror itself. So this, what's involved here is a juror reporting what she heard during the deliberations.  And it seems to me that's exactly the kind of thing that is Alderson Reporting Company not permitted."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":5,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"But it's too easy to convert anything that occurs into the jury room as reflecting on the voir dire.  So the judge instructs the jury.  Can you follow my instructions?  Oh, yes, I can follow my instructions.  In the jury room, that juror says:  Oh, come on, let's just average it all up and go home.  Didn't -- didn't follow instructions.  On your theory that could come in, because it goes to dishonesty at the voir dire stage.

Why not?"},{"name":"JUSTICE ALITO","id":6,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"I think you're missing the point of Justice Ginsburg's question.  The question is not whether the McDonough claim ultimately would Alderson Reporting Company prevail.  The question is whether the testimony from jurors about what went on in the jury room is going to be solicited in an effort to prove a McDonough claim."},{"name":"JUSTICE ALITO","id":6,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"And I guess your answer to -- what's implicit in what you're saying is that it would be permissible to receive that testimony in that situation."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"I'm sorry.  I didn't follow that.  You said lawyers always have an interest in talking to -- what's to prevent them from doing so if the payoff could be as significant as you're looking for. Alderson Reporting Company"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":5,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"But what is the strong evidence of intentional dishonesty in this case?  The woman says:  I can judge this case fairly, I can award damages.  And one of the other things that the judge instructs the jury:  You can take account of your own life experience. What is so blatant about that?        How do we infer that she intended to be dishonest at the time of the voir dire?"},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Well, it's pretty ambiguous.  She said if -- if she had been sued, she would have to pay a lot of damages, right?  Well, this guy has been sued.  I mean, I don't know that you can just take that and says that means she's not going to award a judgment in favor of the -- of the plaintiff."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Well I guess the reason I ask is precisely for that reason.  In other words, it's a fairly broad inquiry.  The circumstances in which you would allow an inquiry are fairly broad.  It's not simply when there's a smoking gun, but a very debatable point about, well, she -- she didn't want to award damages because if her daughter had been sued it would ruin her life, as opposed to, well, she realized there'd Alderson Reporting Company be a lot of damages here because the guy was sued."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":7,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"My problem is not -- is not that, the difficulty of proving that it did demonstrate dishonesty during the voir dire.   My problem is what you also have to establish, namely that this does not constitute an inquiry into the validity of a verdict or indictment."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":7,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Thatâ€™s 606(b)(1), and why are you raising this issue?   Because you want to set aside the verdict, right?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":7,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Right."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":8,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Except -- why -- why would you have an inquiry into the validity of the verdict absent juror misconduct?   You're not going to use that statement in any other part of your case."},{"name":"JUSTICE KAGAN","id":9,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"I guess I don't understand that, Mr. Shanmugam.   I mean, one reason that a verdict can be invalid has to do with what happens in the jury room.   And another reason why a verdict can be invalid might have to do with the composition of the jury itself. And why we should read that language to include the first but not the second I guess I'm just not getting as a matter of language. Alderson Reporting Company"},{"name":"JUSTICE KAGAN","id":9,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"I know, but -- so maybe we're just going back and forth here.   But an inquiry into the validity of the verdict means asking the question, is the verdict valid?   And the question, is the verdict valid, can have answers that refer either to the deliberative process itself or to the composition of the jury."},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"I haven't -- I haven't quite counted, but you keep saying this is a McDonough claim.   If you read the McDonough case, Chief Justice Rehnquist does not cite Rule 606.   He does not cite. I think I'm correct."},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"And so you want to tell us, don't look at Rule 606.   Just look at McDonough. That's what you're telling us.   It's a whole --"},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"But it also requires you to look at who is producing the evidence.   And here, the juror is producing the evidence and McDonough was a third person.   It's different."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":5,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"But you're taking a case that had nothing to do with a juror testifying about what -- what -- the deliberations in the jury room.   I think you're using the case for much more than it's worth, much more than the opinion writer put into it. It just didn't present the question of what about a juror testifying about the deliberations in the jury room."},{"name":"JUSTICE ALITO","id":6,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"This is what troubles me about your -- your argument.   I suspect, maybe I'm wrong and you tell me if I am, that in a case where there's a lot at stake, a really good lawyer loses a case and there was a lot on the line.   And let's suppose this lawyer gets a transcript of what was said in the jury room.   Do you think it is going to be very hard for the lawyer to find something that some juror said that can be used to make out a somewhat plausible claim that the -- that the juror was dishonest during voir dire? The juror promises during voir dire to be fair, and it appears from this transcript the lawyer was for the plaintiff or for the defendant from the first minute of deliberations.   Or the juror says, I will follow the jury instructions.   And then at some point, the juror is making an argument that's inconsistent with the jury instructions.   Do you see the problem?"},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Is -- under your reading of 606(b), is there anything that is an inquiry into the validity of a verdict other than a motion to set aside the verdict?"},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Well, what would -- that motion would be presumably a motion to set aside the verdict."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"The reason I ask is because they don't say that.   It seems to me a broader definition of any inquiry into the validity of a verdict.   If they wanted to say, you know -- if they only meant a motion to set aside a verdict, you'd think they would have said that."},{"name":"JUSTICE ALITO","id":6,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"A party has a right to a competent jury, doesn't it?"},{"name":"JUSTICE ALITO","id":6,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Constitutional right to that.   And yet, you couldn't inquire -- we -- the Court has held that there can't be an inquiry into whether the jurors were intoxicated?"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":5,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"That was leaving out the Alderson Reporting Company conspicuous difference, there was no jury verdict impugned in the contempt case."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Thank you, counsel.

So that -- the jury is not sacrosanct.  The court has already said that the proceeding for contempt doesn't involve the verdict and it's a criminal action, and not permit the use of that evidence in the civil Alderson Reporting Company trial. The same thing will have happened in both situations.   The jury's sanctity has been invaded."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":5,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Is -- Ms. Birnbaum, is there no way, is there no way to police the honesty of jurors' answers on voir dire?

The jurors are asked during voir dire, can you be fair to every -- to parties regardless of race.   Oh, yes, yes, we can.  And then after there's a verdict, a juror comes -- comes forward and says during the jury deliberations, the jurors were making all kinds of biased statements and they were clearly prejudiced.   What would happen there?"},{"name":"JUSTICE KAGAN","id":9,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Well, do you think that with respect to the kind of case that Justice Alito has in mind, a case of racial bias and let's put it in a criminal context, that maybe it's not up to Congress, that at some point one begins to run into constitutional issues?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":7,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Why -- why is that the -- I mean, would we make an exception to normal hearsay rules where racial bias is the issue?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":7,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"I don't think so."},{"name":"JUSTICE KAGAN","id":9,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"I suppose one idea -- because we have relied a lot on the efficacy of other safeguards, and this isn't this case, so you can just say it's not this case.

Is anybody going to do that?"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":5,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Can you explain the manner in which the jury reached its verdict?   I thought that the testimony of Titus was she made this statement about her daughter and she persuaded all the other jurors to go along with her.
