Where do you get that out of the word \"occasion\"?  I would -- I would think \"occasion\" means at any time prior, whether it's at the court -- whether it's at the district court or the court of appeals.  You -- you read it.

Or mean what you suggest, period?"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Mr. Shanmugam, would you explain that distinction from the court of appeals level?

It's counted as a third strike, and then that is reversed on appeal.  So that, you know, turns out it shouldn't have been the third strike.  And I don't know, what do you do in the last case?  In the next case he has only two strikes.  That is a messy situation.  How often does that situation arise?  How often is it that a District Court dismisses for frivolousness and is reversed by the Court of Appeals?

The third strike, seeking a stay of the judgment, and if in fact it is because of a failure to state a claim, so has more merit than one of the frivolous ones, I suppose the Court of Appeals could grant a stay, and the problem we're addressing would totally go away."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Yeah, but that's a problem that is always presented when you have to ask a District Court to stay its own judgment.  But you can also ask the Court of Appeals, right?"},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"No, you just stay the judgment.  Because the judgment -- I mean, that's the typical reason you ask for a stay is because the judgment is going to have some very adverse consequences that should be suspended pending appeal."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":6,"spokeBefore":3,"sideBefore":"justices","text":"I'm sorry.  I'm a little confused here.  There's no judgment to be entered if the prisoner can't file because of the third strike.

Once you admitted, which you must, that in one case there can be two strikes, then if there's a second case, a third case, or no, a second case, but a third strike at the District Court level, you still have to face the question of whether there's a right to appeal --"},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":7,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Are you saying the government is being illogical or inconsistent, because if strike number 3 is a District Court ruling, the government says, well, there's no bar to your appealing that.

I mean, what they argue is if we take your interpretation, it has to be final to become a strike, all that takes time, and if you have a really real frequent filer during that year, perhaps you will file 38 more cases or maybe a hundred and there will be no way to stop him really.  You'll have to pay for the -- you know, I mean, you see the problem. On the other hand, the evil that you're worried about, which is that there is a reversal of a strike on appeal, has happened precisely zero times. Ever.  So this sort of undermines the statute.  There's not a real need for it, your interpretation, and if there were by the way and it were reversed, he could proceed under Rule 60(b)5.  So that's basically their argument.  I would like to hear your answer."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":5,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Now, wait.  Wait, wait, Alderson Reporting Company wait, wait, wait.  I mean, what's distinctive about yours is you have to wait for the period of the appeal. You have to -- and, you know, that could take a long time.  And you talk about floodgates.  The reason this statute exists is because of floodgates, because these prisoners file one -- one frivolous appeal after another."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Mr. Shanmugam, why isn't this case just a casebook example of what the danger is? Because this Petitioner, as I understand it, filed not only the petition that's before us, but three more.  In what span of time?"},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":7,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Well, but he's making up for lost time. (Laughter.)"},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":7,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"But -- but I don't -- I don't think that your earlier point that when he has two strikes he can file a flurry of suits is relevant. That's -- that's the grace period that the government Alderson Reporting Company has given him.  The government has granted that with only two strikes, you can proceed.  But now we have three, and that's quite different."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":6,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Do you know if any of those courts, the majority of the courts except for two, have opted  for addressing things your way?  And -- and I have a slight leaning towards letting the majority of circuit courts figure out administrative -- the ease of administrative rules.  How many of them thought of it as just being easier to do?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":5,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Again -- again, that's a big problem depending upon how frequent that is.  If it's once in a blue moon, you know, it's no big deal."},{"name":"JUSTICE ALITO","id":9,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Well, I would think that the -- I would think the situation that we should be concerned about is the situation in which the dismissal, which is initially counted as the third strike, ultimately results in some relief for the prisoner.  And I don't know that there's even one of those."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Thank you, Counsel. Mr. Lindstrom. "},{"name":"JUSTICE KAGAN","id":10,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Mr. Lindstrom, I -- I understand that argument, and it seems to me a very natural reading of the statute.  But the -- I'm troubled by the scenario where it's dismissed and then it's reversed, not for these practical reasons that people have been talking about.  But it seems to me that if you were really reading the statute that way, that that would count as a strike, too, and that that strike would not go away even when it was reversed. And so I'm wondering whether the statute is actually a little bit more ambiguous than -- than you are suggesting, because at the very least, I mean, everybody agrees that you have to make an exception for that case, and it seems to me that on your reading of the statute, that case would be included.  A strike would be a strike even if it's reversed."},{"name":"JUSTICE KAGAN","id":10,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Yes, but that's something -- you're now appealing to some default principle that exists outside of the statutory text.  I can't find any basis in the statutory text for that result. I mean, it's -- there have been three or more prior occasions in which either an action or an appeal has been dismissed.  Now, one of those dismissals was later reversed, but it was dismissed.  And so on your reading, we -- we really, you know, it's -- it's -- your reading is kind of -- this is the natural reading, but we're not going to -- we're not going to apply the natural reading in a case where it obviously doesn't fit."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":6,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"The problem with the Alderson Reporting Company ordinary rule is that it really doesn't apply completely until the next case.  It applies in that case, but it doesn't apply in the next case."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":6,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Meaning let's talk about res judicata or collateral estoppel.  If it's res judicata, it's the two parties.  So that -- that's that case, essentially."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":6,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"If it's collateral estoppel, it could be until a third party.  But I think that that third party would be entitled to a stay of his or her action pending the adjudication of the main action."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":6,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Except that the -- there's still a right to ask the court of appeals for a COA, and so there is an appellate process of sorts."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":6,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Right.  Answer -- answer Judge -- Judge Easterbrook's point, that there is no way to revive a subsequently filed case that was dismissed because of a third strike.  Judge Easterbrook, and I think there's some force to his logic, says with this -- this three-strike situation, when the next case comes to Alderson Reporting Company the court of -- to a district court, district court never files the complaint.  There was nothing dismissed that can be revived.  There was no judgment entered."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":6,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"But -- but there's no remedy for the fact that subsequent lawsuits that were -- that were filed based on the erroneous third strike would have been turned back without the filing of a complaint."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":6,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"And nothing -- or to file a 60(b)."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":8,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"What does it cost to file"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":8,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Sorry?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":6,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Sort of an interesting question, basically admitting that in terms of your time, the suits would still remain because they could file in State court?"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":4,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Do states have similar rules?"},{"name":"JUSTICE KAGAN","id":10,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"You know, I guess what I'm not quite sure about in your answer to my question, Mr. Lindstrom, is, if I understand you right, and tell me if I don't, you're basically saying that we look to these background principles and we decide that a strike doesn't happen if something is reversed on appeal, so a strike is kind of dependent on what happens on appeal. But when you say that, aren't you kind of giving up your best argument?  I mean, aren't you then admitting that the notion of a strike encompasses what happens on appeal and encompasses finality on appeal?"},{"name":"JUSTICE ALITO","id":9,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"This is a question I probably should have asked petitioner, but what do you understand his -- what do you understand him to mean when he says it has to be final on appeal? Suppose that there is an appeal pending in one of the prior strike cases, but it's perfectly clear that the notice of appeal in that instance was filed woefully out of time.  Would that be final on appeal?"},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":7,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Under your position, I suppose we don't have to ask about certiorari, pending Alderson Reporting Company whether or not that --"},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":7,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"You can say that that's the petitioner's problem, not yours."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":8,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"What do you think about the government's argument about the third?  You imagine he has -- the prisoner has filed one, dismissed as frivolous; appeal, the dismissal affirmed.  That's one. Now he does it again.  That's two.  And he does it a third time.  District court dismissed.  And he says, I want to appeal that, and I don't want to pay the $500, 505.  And the government has to say -- could say, sorry, you have to pay the 505.  That's the third, because he's a separate.  Then he says, but it says, \"on a prior occasion,\" and this is the same occasion.  And therefore he doesn't have to pay the 500.  What's your view of that?"},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":7,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"It seems to me the government does give away too much in that position.  The only question is whether that undercuts this whole argument.  It gives a little bonus for the appeal of the -- if strike number three is the district court, the government doesn't count the appeal, as I understand it.  It counts -- obviously it counts in a later district court suit, but not here."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":6,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Why use the word \"occasion\" at all?  Meaning:  What meaning do you give to that word?  Why didn't they just say \"three dismissals\"?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":6,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"It seems to me you could Alderson Reporting Company have just said, if a prisoner has three dismissals, then -- three prior dismissals; not three prior occasions, three prior dismissals -- he can't get IFP thereafter."},{"name":"JUSTICE ALITO","id":9,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"What about the fact that this provision refers to a prior occasion on which an action was dismissed?

Now you say a prior occasion is not the district court dismissal in this third case.  That's not a prior occasion.  But when you look at the earlier two strikes, you don't consider it as a whole.
