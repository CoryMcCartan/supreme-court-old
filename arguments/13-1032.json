That's a straight reporting requirement, and you recognize that that's covered by the TIA.  So this is another information reporting that will enable or facilitate the State's collection of its tax.

In this case, the injunction, by stopping sellers from telling the State how much the Colorado citizen has bought, would make it more difficult for them to collect the tax. So if collection includes in the one case an injunction that makes it more difficult to collect an income tax, why doesn't it in this case include an injunction that makes it more difficult to Alderson Reporting Company collect a use tax?  The point was they are identical conceptually. Now, I donâ€™t care whether it's -- who -- who brings the suit.  In terms of the word \"collection,\" they seem identical.

I think you could deny that it enjoins the collection of a tax.

And I assign one of my clerks, go collect the money for the pizza. So what that clerk is going to do is he's going to figure out who it is that's going to owe the money, right?  Who's going to partake of the pizza, so who owes the money.  And then, you know, maybe he's going to send an e-mail to those people and he's going to say you owe this money for pizza.  And then if no -- if somebody doesn't pay, he's going to identify the delinquent and -- and say, really, you owe this money for pizza. So that's all part of the collection process, isn't it?

That's true of houses.  It's true of food.   It's true of -- in States that tax food.  It's true of this desk.   It's true of everything you can think of.   And therefore, there will be -- I mean, ruled Alderson Reporting Company out, unless you are going to start line drawing, and I don't know what lines to draw. Therefore, said Henry Friendly, let's not. Let us read collection to mean what it means in context, namely what Hibbs suggests the three phrases mean.   Read them together.

I think you Alderson Reporting Company acknowledged earlier that if we hold that your statute cannot be challenged under the Tax Injunction Act and it's ultimately determined to be constitutional, this would be very attractive for all the other States to copy. So let's -- let's suppose that that happens and so now every State has a law like this, and every State -- and there are many different variations in the forms.   Maybe there are 50 forms that have to be submitted to State tax authorities.   And let's say I start up a small business and I'm selling a few thousand dollars worth of goods via the internet to people from all over the country. Now I will have to submit potentially 50 different forms to all of these States reporting that somebody in South Carolina purchased something from me that cost 23.99.   Now, I know you have a -- you have a requirement that it has to reach a certain threshold, but I don't see it and that's just something that you've chosen to do.

So it is important that it begin in Federal court when -- especially when what is at issue is the selfish State's assessment and collection of taxes.

So her clerks are collecting money for pizza to be had at night and let's say the Chief Justice says this is fine, but you -- you may not use court e-mail to try to collect this.
