There’s no substantial evidence to the contrary. But you, the company, want to take money from her instead of giving her the money. Now, I’ve read the record. It doesn't support anything contrary to what I’ve said. So now you send it back. Now, what is that but a big victory for the other side? Which then leaves the company to say: They're right; pay them.

And your adversary says the court found an ERISA violation. Now, the type of relief it grants is up to its discretion.

The ERISA administrator was -- it's an abuse of his discretion to refuse to give this woman nothing. In my opinion, she's entitled at least to $30,000, but whether it's 30 or 35, I don't know. So I remand it to the ERISA administrator so he can decide to act within -- within his discretion, give her either 30, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.

If you don't, he's done. End of case. Sent back to the administrator."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":9,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"That may be, but why can't they do this? What would be wrong with this heretical idea, that as long as the plaintiff wins something out of the court, the district judge -- that group of people we were talking about -- has discretion to decide whether ultimately they got something significant of what they wanted, and as long as that judgment helped them get them something significantly of what they wanted, attorney's fees are fine; and we leave it all up to the district judge as long as the district judge doesn't abuse the discretion that that standard gives him?

What would happen that would be so terrible if we said something like that?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":9,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"It didn't say anything against the catalyst theory.
