Alderson Reporting Company"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":10,"spokeBefore":9,"sideBefore":"justices","text":"All right.  And I thought the reason -- you have to answer it -- is because when you have many steps in a process, and this is a very similar process of the book I'm reading now about the Seabees building constructions in World War II, you know, they put some forward warehouses and they put some other stuff in some other warehouses and they make the eventual thing by shipping this from over there and the other place.  So it's tough. Now, youâ€™ll probably want to insist upon a pretty strict relationship between the different parties in a joint venture or more before you hold them liable. In other words, there's an issue I don't know about. How close was this relationship?

It's a strict liability tort."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":6,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Well, even knownst -- even knownst to each other, but -- but one of them who is knownst doesn't know about the patent.

I mean, you Alderson Reporting Company can look at the Federal Circuit's ruling and say it makes no sense.  How can you induce infringement if there's no infringement in the first place.  And that's a very strong argument.  But the reason they put this under 271(b) rather than under 271(a) is because of what Justice Scalia said, that 271(b) is not a strict liability offense, and so that you can say, you have to know and you have to have instructed the -- the person. So, you know, they thought that they were being very clever by putting it into a 271(b) box and avoiding the strict liability consequences of what they were doing, but also avoiding the possibility of an end run of the patent law."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":6,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"And also avoiding the text of the statute.

And that is a supplier who makes customized materials, some of which involve standardized materials and some of which have to be made fresh, and where the specialists are in crowded cities.  But -- and so it takes time to put it on the truck and get out of the city. But the standardized parts can be shipped from anywhere in the country.  Has a system of phoning Alderson Reporting Company up standardized people and customized people and putting them all together, and it involves the customer. And there are not just two steps.        There are 87 steps, and many of them involve very innocent things like taking a truck and driving it from one place to another. Now, when we get into something as complicated as that -- and this is one is even more so -- and many of them are things that people do every day, and there are all kinds of states of knowledge, I become very nervous about writing a rule that suddenly might lead millions of people to start suing each other.
