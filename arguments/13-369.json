Now, as soon as you say that, that's his point.  His point is that when I read it -- I guess that's the point that's being made. When I read it, it just seems to me that the green one can't touch the blue one, and the whole thing has to fit within your hand, so each of them catches a finger.  And he's saying that isn't good enough.  That doesn't work. They have to be the same distance.  And what that distance is, this document doesn't tell us.
