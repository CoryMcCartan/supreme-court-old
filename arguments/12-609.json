So the government says, we would like to have you examined by our doctor, Dr. B, who we believe will -- and the judge orders it.  All right.

Because you say your case is different, but I think you'll have to explain that one to me.  It seems to me that the cross-examination cases say you can't become a witness halfway.  Once you've decided to become a witness, you have to subject yourself to all the things that every other witness is subjected to. And it seems to me that you haven't convinced me that the same point isn't true here, that Alderson Reporting Company the person, Mr. Cheever, has decided to become a witness, essentially, by giving an interview to his own expert and allowing his own expert to speak about what Mr. Cheever has told him.  And so -- you know, he can't do it halfway.  Now, the government has to get its shot. Same way."},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":5,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Well, that's something of an overstatement because he also had the psychiatrist Alderson Reporting Company who testified that, in his expert opinion, he did not have the requisite mental state, and he -- and he prefaced that by indicating how many people he had examined that had used meth and there was neurotoxicity, so this defense expert did testify to that."},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":5,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"So I think you quite overstate when you say the fact the defendant testified."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":10,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"But that's scope issues.

So how does that maybe help defendants who want to put on a defense of mental state?  You can't put it on, unless the government can put it on.  That's the current rule. But you're saying the response to it can be this evidence is shut out entirely.  The government -- the government will have nothing to answer if the defendant doesn't put on experts.

So because of the reasons -- I'd say the policies underlying the Fourth Amendment, the court says, that's wrong.  He can go testify at the suppression hearing, and then they can't use his statement later.  So by analogy, he says, it's a similar situation.  He says, it's the policy behind the Fifth Amendment that says, if you're going to go see the government under compulsion -- the psychiatrist, you shouldn't be able to introduce that later.
