Essentially, it's their question. Let's say that the -- the decision about admissions criteria across the board is basically delegated to the faculty.  All right?

So maybe it's overruled by the -- the dean of -- by a dean, or maybe it's overruled by the president of the university.  Maybe it's overruled by the regents.

I thought the line was a very simple one, which is if the normal academic decision-making is in the dean, the faculty, at whatever level, as long as the normal right to control is being exercised, then that person could change the decision. So if they delegate most admissions decisions, as I understand from the record, to the Alderson Reporting Company faculty, but they still regularly, besides race, veto some of those decisions, and race is now one of them, then the Board of Regents can do that normally.  So could the president, if that's the way it's normally done.
