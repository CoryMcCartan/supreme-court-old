Essentially, it's their question. Let's say that the -- the decision about admissions criteria across the board is basically delegated to the faculty.  All right?

So maybe it's overruled by the -- the dean of -- by a dean, or maybe it's overruled by the president of the university.  Maybe it's overruled by the regents.

So if they delegate most admissions decisions, as I understand from the record, to the Alderson Reporting Company faculty, but they still regularly, besides race, veto some of those decisions, and race is now one of them, then the Board of Regents can do that normally.
