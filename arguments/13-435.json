The alternative, of course, is to issue registration statements that have statements in them of opinion, very detailed, very fact-based, and where people would think some work was being done, and, in fact, far less work has been done than anybody would Alderson Reporting Company think was plausible, and they just float right by without attack.

And that person has also consulted three lawyers, and two of them have given a different view.  But he still believes what he believes. He believes that the Supreme Court is going to vindicate his legal position. But the only thing he says is, I think this is lawful.  Now, why isn't that something where there is an omission that makes the statements misleading?"},{"name":"JUSTICE KAGAN","id":8,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Well, it just says statements therein.

And I guess what I'm saying is, you know, what I've given you is a case where this is a judgment call, whether you think something is legal or not. But what you know -- and after all you're in the position to know and all your readers are not in a position to know.  What you know is that the Government seems to disagree, that your competitors seem to Alderson Reporting Company disagree, and that most of the lawyers seem to disagree. And still you're going to put this in your statement and say, oh, no problem, that's not misleading."},{"name":"JUSTICE KAGAN","id":8,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"But don't you think a reasonable reader would look at that statement and say two things actually:  Both, he's done something to try to check as to whether the transaction is legal, and he doesn't know anything that's very dispositive going the other way.

Why is it a strict liability statute?  Because Congress had some understanding, number one, that it was the issuer who knows the facts, not the readers; and number two, that it is awfully hard to show subjective intent."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Goldstein.

Was that correct?"},{"name":"JUSTICE ALITO","id":6,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Since that's the holding of the Sixth Circuit, don't we at a minimum have an obligation to vacate and remand?  Because they didn't hold that their reasonable basis standard was satisfied here."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":4,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"But assuming they're wrong about this, they said the Section 11 does not require a plaintiff to plead a defendant's state of mind, and a statement of opinion is actionable when it is ultimately found to be false. Now, that, I don't think, is what you are arguing, what the SG is arguing.  The point is that the statement, it is my opinion that the warehouse will hold up in a 93-mile-an-hour wind for 17 hours as long as the windows are closed.  And that statement may be false, but it may also be true that the issuer before issuing the statement performed a variety of tests, in which case you would agree, I think, that it is not actionable. And so -- so it isn't just that it's false, it's that there was no reasonable basis for holding it. Moreover, whether the issuer has a reasonable basis is a Alderson Reporting Company fact about the issuer's state of mind.  It isn't whether there's a reasonable basis in the world.  It is about whether those people who issued this statement had a reasonable basis for issuing it or not.  I think that's about their state of mind in a sense.  But those two things, I think, do require reversal."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":7,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Sorry, that doesn't -- Alderson Reporting Company that doesn't make much sense to me.

They said, in our opinion, we have X amount of inventory.  And you're starting out by saying, well, it is an opinion, but an opinion carries the implication that they would have some basis for it.  And they did have a basis for it.  In fact, they had a reasonable basis.  So how there can the plaintiff recover?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":4,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Okay.  You've given me those times.  What about the other times?"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":5,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Mr. Goldstein, can I just clarify what seems to be your point.  You do not take the reasonable factual basis.  You are saying it's the same thing as if we excised \"we believe.\"  That you take that out, and then you have a statement of fact which is false, and then they're responsible.  So you're really saying there is no such thing as an opinion versus a Alderson Reporting Company fact, that it's just the same as if they left out \"we believe.\""},{"name":"JUSTICE KAGAN","id":8,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Isn't that exactly what you have here?  Because if you look at these registration statements, you know, we have been looking at one or two sentences in a vacuum, but, in fact, if you look at the registration statements themselves, they're sort of surrounded by reasons to discount the opinion.  It says, you know, CMS, the government might think differently, and if that's so, we're really in bad shape.  It says, these laws may be interpreted in the future in a manner inconsistent with our interpretation.  I mean, it seems to me that they actually did a pretty good job of saying, look, we think this, but there are -- there are some problems -- Alderson Reporting Company"},{"name":"JUSTICE KAGAN","id":8,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"-- with this and it could go the other way."},{"name":"JUSTICE KAGAN","id":8,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Could I just make sure I understand, Mr. Goldstein?  The basis of your argument in the text is not the untrue statement of material facts language, right?  Because I would take it that you agree with the government and with Mr. Shanmugam that as to that, the only untrue statement in an opinion is whether you hold it?  But the basis of your view, both Alderson Reporting Company as to agreeing with the government and also suggesting that a further view is the omissions language; is that right?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":7,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Well, there in that case of Virginia Banks, it was a given, it was stipulated or proven already by the jury verdict that they didn't believe what they said."},{"name":"JUSTICE ALITO","id":6,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Well, if it's not purely subjective, if it's the reasonable basis test, what does that mean?
