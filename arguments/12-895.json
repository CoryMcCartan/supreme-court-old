I thought the example that you were relying on here or the issue that got confused in the briefs was whether or not, from the sequence of facts in this case, you can actually discern that intent to facilitate the crime because the alleged shooter, which your client said was someone else, jumped into the car and the car took off before anybody could abandon the crime.  That's what I actually thought this case was about:  At what juncture do you instruct the jury to say that you have to be a participant with knowledge of the crime?
