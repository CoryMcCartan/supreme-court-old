And I don't see how you could understand it unless you have in the complaint what your theory is.  That's all.  Nobody is asking for some facts.  Is your theory that the loss took place at the time the person bought the stock because he overpaid $30?  Is your theory that the stock went down and, because of that, he lost the money?  Is your theory that the stock didn't go down but it would have gone up more?  All they're asking is not for evidence, but a simple, clear explanation of the theory, and plead in the alternative if you want.  But I mean, what's the problem? Why is that so hard to do?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":6,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"And this case doesn't seem to do it.  I looked through the entire complaint.

Yes, you have to tell the details of the fraud.  No, you don't have to tell the details of the loss.  But you do have to have a theory on which you can recover, and if your theory is simply I bought at an inflated price and the law doesn't give you a claim for relief on that theory, then you're out the window.  There's no discovery.  There's nothing. You have to have, as Justice Souter pointed out, a viable theory of relief, and that's the difference between -- you say it's enough that the stock was selling for much more than it should have, and the other side said, no, that's not enough.  You have to show that when the misrepresentation was corrected, the price dropped."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":7,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Why?  I don't understand.

You cannot recover any loss except the loss that was caused by the fraud in question.  In theory, that limit is established by the inflation at the time you purchase.  So that is the limit of your recovery, but it does not follow from that that you have anything to recover for until you have your actual loss if you're pleading a -- a fraud-on- the-market theory.
