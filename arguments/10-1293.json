And I do think that that is the major objection, that we have a government agency that is going to make decisions about when nudity is okay and when it isn't.  You can't do it in terms of time because \"New York\" -- the \"NYPD\" was 7 seconds and another broadcast, \"Catch-22,\" was 40 seconds.

They didn't really, or we didn't, or the Court didn't, attack the 2001 order which is now at issue.  And then, without it going back to the commission, the Second Circuit decided it on a ground that sets aside the 2001 order. Now, can we here just decide the fleeting expletive case, because the fleeting expletive case has to do with one subset of applications of the 2001 orderand has to do with part 2(2) or something.  I mean, it has -- and how you interpret the words \"material dwells on or repeats.\"  Now, that I -- that I understand how to get at. The ABC case raises -- doesn't raise fleeting expletives.  It wasn't fleeting.  And it raises the question of the validity of -- under vagueness grounds, of 2001 industry guidance and how that's been applied.  But the Second Circuit didn't deal with that case.  It sent it back to the commission. So, has there been a commission decision recently which has reviewed the basic arguments being made here about the validity of the 2001 industry guidance as applied?  Has there been such a thing?
