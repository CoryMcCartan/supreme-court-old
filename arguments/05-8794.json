All right. Now, that doesn't seem too difficult. Maybe it's difficult, but it doesn't seem too difficult. So why can't they think, you know, Florida -- they can read there too.

And that if it's a challenge to the execution itself, it has to be brought under habeas. If it's just a challenge to the 1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 method, it can be brought under 1983.

And there, the Court denied a stay of the execution because it looked into the history of the litigation, and they said that this particular individual had done just what worries you, though in a somewhat different context. He kept bringing the cases, and every time, you know, he'd lose. Then he'd think of another way of making the same point, and in your context, it would be first he challenges this method and he says there are others that are fine. So we go to another. Then he challenges that. Then he challenges that. Then he challenges that, always at the very last minute. So there's a case that provides a weapon if the abuse that you worry about occurs. So why do we need something else like an 1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 absolute rule of some sort that the Petitioner has to think of a method of execution, a matter on which he is not necessarily expert, that would turn out in the future to be not painful?
