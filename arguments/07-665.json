I know how you're going to answer that question. You're going to say: Of course, it is. But what's interesting me is, are we bound in these cases to apply what I think of as an artificial kind of conceptual framework or are we free to ask what seems to me to be at the heart of the matter?

Why isn't the answer to the question that monuments generally are not -- the erection of monuments generally are not a forum? There is a fundamental difference between the speaker's corner in the park where anybody can speak and a permanent monument that takes up space, presumably limited public space. And if you have the unusual situation where you are have a monument that is really analogous to a forum, then the forum analysis would be applicable.

You can't have it both ways, you've got to pick one or the other; and it is -- it is the Government aspect which controls the First Amendment purposes.

And now if I searched the town records or the county record and I don't find any resolution saying they adopted this monument as their monument, does that mean that if I would like to put up a monument in the park to commemorate loved ones who died, or people who I respect, I have a First Amendment right to do that?"},{"name":"JUSTICE ALITO","id":9,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Well what if the situation is a neighborhood association prepared this; they said we'd like to display it in the park; and the county or the town says fine, go ahead and do it?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":5,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Ms. Harris, we -- we need a clear rule here.
