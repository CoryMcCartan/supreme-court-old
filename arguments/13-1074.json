Because you're saying, well, this is similar enough and maybe this would be a little bit different, it has a few fewer words, and then we have to look at the history, and we have to stare at the drafting concerns of Congress.

But there are two kinds of ways that you can rebut something.  One is by saying, here's something very distinctive about this statute that shows that Congress meant for it to be jurisdictional, that shows that Congress didn't mean for equitable tolling to apply.  But that's not the kind of argument you are making here.  You're making an argument that basically says in this pre-Irwin world, Congress understood that when it came to statutes against the government, they would be jurisdictional and equitable tolling would not apply, see the Tucker Act.  And that could be said, I think, for every statute with respect Alderson Reporting Company to suits against the government prior to Irwin."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"I thought Soriano was -- was a Tucker Act case."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"But if the sovereign immunity is what drives it, then the presumption would be overcome in every case against the government because government -- Alderson Reporting Company"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":8,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Is there another -- is there another reason -- I think both briefs are good briefs and you each have good arguments.  And so if it's an open question, why does the government oppose this? That is to say, compared to contracts, people who are suing on contracts usually have a lawyer and they have had lawyers, they're dealing with the government, not all.  But this is about torts.  And people who are hurt with torts are frequently badly hurt, they could be anyone in the world.  The government could have treated them very badly.  Lots of things can happen. Hurricanes.  The lawyer gets deathly ill on the way to the courthouse.  The clerk mixes up the papers. Somebody steals the lawyer's briefs and runs off to Chicago. I mean, all kinds of odd things can happen to a victim of a tort caused by the United States.  Now, if in fact you throw them out on this thing, which I would call a technicality, he has to go to the Senate and he has to ask them for a private bill, which is a drain on their time and somewhat random.  So those are Alderson Reporting Company the real choices. Now, why other than, well, we read it and that's what the law is -- I got that part and that is not a bad argument on your part.  But is there anything else?  Is there any sort of functional reason why the government doesn't just say, look, where this person's been hurt and can win his court, fine, we won't throw him out on the basis of this.  If the hurricane happens, et cetera, then let's proceed anyway."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":8,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"That there's nothing else?

To get equitable tolling, it's a pretty tough case.  In order to get equitable tolling, you must have a truly exceptional case, maybe the case that we're now -- that's now before us is such a case. Alderson Reporting Company But it is not easy to get equitable tolling.  You have to be especially deserving. So isn't that the answer to it?        Ordinarily, the statute of limitations will govern, but if there are equitable reasons, then there can be an exception.  But those reasons have to be very strong."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":8,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"If you want to -- I think it is quite funny, what I said. I'm sorry. Of course, the question is the law, all right. I think what I said before is relevant to the law. But the question here is a slightly more subtle one in my mind. I agree with you, the legislative history, et cetera, does show they used \"jurisdiction\" nonstop. Those are the words. But \"jurisdiction\" at that time did not have the Irwin meaning. And so later on, there comes a case, which case Irwin now treats this quite differently than it did before. And isn't the question -- or is the question from the legislative history point of view a pretty hard one to answer: Did Congress or would those who passed the bill looking at the reasons wanted this statute to pick up the later interpretation of jurisdiction or they Alderson Reporting Company wanted it to have stayed the same in the face of that later change in how the courts treat the word."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"A living Federal Tort Claims Act is what we're talking about here.

How did Congress -- or would because it's hypothetical -- they didn't know?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":8,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"They didn't -- they had the tolling.

They said here are these two statutes waiving the government's sovereign immunity.  The Tucker Act, no equitable tolling.

It's other language that is just lifted verbatim from the two prior Acts. And you add to that the fact that the purpose of this statute was to eliminate the exception in the Tucker Act for torts. The --"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":4,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"That was the obvious purpose of it, so they -- they repeat the language of the Tucker Act and say it applies to torts.

You have to pick one argument or the other."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":4,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Are you -- are you going to be bound by -- by what the Congress at the time believed it was enacting or not?

But it's hard for me to believe that Congress really had any intent whatsoever on -- on these issues. I don't envision members of Congress sitting around thinking about these things. But put that aside. Do you -- is it your argument that we should follow congressional intent or not? Or is it your argument that Congress's intent was to adopt -- to say this is jurisdictional and we delegate, basically, to the courts the -- the determination of what is jurisdictional? So if they change their mind about the difference between jurisdiction and non-jurisdiction, then that's what this should mean. Which -- which is it?"},{"name":"JUSTICE ALITO","id":7,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"So it's not what Congress intended.  You're saying that if they intended to -- all they thought about was they had one idea about jurisdiction, they couldn't conceive of another one, they wanted it to be jurisdictional in accordance with their idea, but that would change.  If -- if others -- if courts begin to think of jurisdiction differently."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":3,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Mr. Schnapper, I think we're getting off the track that Justice Breyer put us on, and I think you agreed with him, that there's no evidence that Congress ever thought anything about what was going to happen in a case like Ms. Wong.  They -- they enacted a statute, and it had a statute of limitations, a firm statute of limitations, but there's no indication that Congress thought about jurisdiction. We all -- all that jurisdiction stuff comes from Alderson Reporting Company decisions of this Court."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Well, but that language -- that language comes from decisions of this Court, exactly.  But interpreting the precise language that was put into this act in the same context ais the Tucker Act.  They were addressing a problem under the Tucker Act, they used that language.  And whatever criticism you want to direct to the prior decisions of the Court, they have issued -- they had issued rulings on those when the Congress was looking at the FTCA."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":4,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Well, that may well be, but --"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":4,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Look, there are a lot of statutes, perhaps most statutes, that are not explicit. That do not use the magic language that you insist this statute have.  And when that happens, we don't just sit Alderson Reporting Company back and say, well, in that case, it's up to us.  We don't say that.  We have certain rules that -- that determine what the presumptive intent of Congress was. And I don't care whether each individual member of Congress or, indeed, any single one of them had that in mind.  They ordinarily don't.  But we have rules, one of which that is very strong, is that when you adopt the language from another statute -- especially when it is in the same area, and this is the same area as the Tucker Act, it is eliminating the Tucker Act exemption for torts.  When you have the same language and it has been -- that language has been interpreted by the courts uniformly over a period of years to mean a certain thing, we will presume that that is what Congress had in mind when it used the language. Now, if you're asking us to abandon that rule and just sit back in -- in any case when the legislative history doesn't say anything and -- and make up what we think should be the best answer, that simply is not the way we've proceeded."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":8,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Didn't -- I mean, the -- sorry, but I get -- I mean, what about many statutes existed saying -- inferring a certain use of the word Alderson Reporting Company about men sitting on juries.  And the statutes that say those things were enacted long before anyone thought a woman would ever sit on a jury.  But when they're interpreted by the courts, by and large, they're interpreted to include both genders.  All right?  There are many instances.  So certainly Justice Scalia is right in my opinion that that is a rule that -- the one he enunciates, but neither an absolutely firm rule nor the only rule."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":4,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"You think man means women, right?  Never mind."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":3,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Mr. Schnapper -- Mr. Schnapper, I think that I heard a disagreement between you and Justice Scalia on how close the words were, and you said, yes, there are some phrases in common, but there are big differences, too, in the wording of the Tort Claims Act.  So you can pick out some words and say, yes, Congress adopted that language, but in other parts it didn't take the Tucker Act as the model used Alderson Reporting Company different language."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Well, but that's a -- a principle that obviously doesn't cut across the board.

You're misunderstanding my point.  In other words, just because the law says the United States will be liable to the same extent as a private party, it doesn't mean that all the rules -- I mean in State court -- it doesn't mean that all the rules that apply in -- that you interpret them the same way across the board.  There is no requirement that you give a two-years notice in the typical State court action.

I mean, the procedures are different, obviously."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":4,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"You know, I don't find the -- the existence of -- of those exceptions, and there are a lot of exceptions, so persuasive, because unlike the Tucker Act, the Tort Claims Act refers to State law, so you have to make exceptions unless you're going to suck in everything about State law, procedures and everything else. So, you know, it's sort of apples and Alderson Reporting Company oranges.  The fact that those exceptions are there are explicable not because Congress didn't think jurisdiction meant jurisdiction in the narrow sense, but, rather, because having referred us to State law, they had to make some exceptions from State law."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":6,"spokeBefore":4,"sideBefore":"justices","text":"Isn't your point, however, that this is a new regime, that it's not the Tucker Act, that it's something created -- they may have borrowed from the Tucker Act some phrases and a couple of things, but they created a new statute.

But the government answered that argument and said there's a difference between equitable doctrines, Alderson Reporting Company which the claims court followed, it's just that the claims court can't give equitable remedies like injunction.
