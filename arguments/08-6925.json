It's exactly the -- it's exactly the statute Florida has. And somebody has a plea, and we don't know from the record what the conduct was.

And what we said in Chambers is that the nature of the behavior that likely underlies a statutory phrase matters in this respect. If you think of the seven different things covered by one statute in James or Chambers, two of them, failing to return from a furlough and failing to return from work in day release, seem to me quite possibly to describe one thing, not two. Now, how do we know that striking or touching describes two things? I couldn't find any instance, and we had the library looking. I couldn't find any instance in Florida where those two things have ever been charged separately. And they looked at hundreds. So -- so why do we think it's two crimes, rather than just one called \"striking or touching\"?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"It does, too, in Chambers.

Would my rearing back and slapping you? In those instances slapping doesn't cause physical injury as that term is defined in the common law, which is an injury of lasting effect.

The issue is not whether it causes serious injury or not, the issue is whether the nature of the force used is physical force. And, so, if you look at the common definition of \"physical force\" in the dictionary, which your adversaries did very well in their brief, physical force has in its ordinary meaning the use of some strength, of some power, and generally kissing doesn't require that strength or power, touching someone on the shoulder, doesn't. All of these activities are prohibited by this statute if they are unwanted. So the question is not whether or not they present the risk of physical injury, the issue is whether in all applications or in a substantial number they don't require the use of strength to -- in its application.

And at that point, you have to decide, is there an element there of force? And I think it requires more force than just the simplest touching. Now, on Justice Scalia's approach, the fact that there is one conviction for spitting is sufficient to take it outside the statute. That's not my approach. I would say, in the mind run of cases, does there have to be more force than just spitting? And now I don't know how it's prosecuted. So why don't I say in this case, from my perspective, very well, I don't know. No one knows. No one has told me. No one has looked into it. It's very hard to look into, but not impossible. It's the Government's job, faced with a 15-year statute, to do the looking. They have the resources. More than a defense attorney.

But in using that definition to define the term \"violent felony,\" I find it hard to believe that Congress was using the term in a technical sense, and was not using the term \"physical force,\" \"the use of physical force\" to mean something more than a mere touching. But that's -- that's basically what we are arguing, isn't it? Whether that -- whether that phrase there, \"threatened use of physical\" -- \"use or threatened use of physical force,\" is technical language which is the definition of battery, or rather more common usage.
