Now, in their question presented, they say, in the last few words in describing it, we think that's wrong. Now, I agree that we have to say whether that's wrong and, if it is wrong, it would be helpful to say what they have to do.  So the SG says, here is what it is.  If the employer correctly infers, correctly understands, and I would add \"or correctly believes\" that a practice is religious and an accommodation is necessary, that's it.

Proving that somebody has a belief or other is probably at issue in 90 percent of them.

Now, people can disagree about whether one can ask those questions in a way that's awkward at all, but you're saying we should structure the whole legal system to make sure that there is no possibility of that awkward conversation ever taking place.  But the alternative to that rule is a rule where Abercrombie just gets to say, we're going to stereotype people and prevent them from getting jobs.  We'll never have the awkward conversation because we're just going to cut these people out and make sure that they never become Abercrombie employees. Now, between those two options, the option of using a stereotype to make sure that somebody never gets a job and using a stereotype to have an awkward conversation, which does this statute seem to think is the worst problem?

There are millions of people who are practicing one religion or another where you get a clue of that from their name or maybe their dress or whatever it is.
