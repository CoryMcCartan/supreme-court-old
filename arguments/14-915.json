But it was years ago. It was years ago. I mean, maybe Marbury v. Madison was wrong. There are people who argue certain aspects were. And the concerns I --  I have in terms of workability are not so much the details. I guess something would work out in the labor area. It would certainly affect the bar.

It didn't cite Pickering, but it essentially had the exact same concerns as Pickering, which was the employer's interest, the -- the government's interest as an employer, and how that related to an employee's speech right and -- and basically arguing for a -- a balancing test. So -- so really what your argument comes down to is two very recent cases, which is Harris and Knox. And there you might say that Harris and Knox gave indications that the Court was not friendly to Abood. But those were two extremely recent cases, and they were both cases that actually were decided within the Abood framework. In the Harris case, the parties came here and explicitly asked us to overrule that case. Almost Alderson Reporting Company all the briefing was about overruling that case, and the Court decided not to overrule that case and instead to say that --  that the employees there were --  were simply not public employees at all. So taking two extremely recent cases, which admittedly expressed some frustration with Abood, but also specifically decided not to overrule Abood, I mean, just seems like it's --  it's nothing of the kind that we usually say when we usually say that a precedent has to be overturned because it's come into conflict with an entire body of case law."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":10,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Well, I -- I --"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":10,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"I'll accept that. Let me accept that what you can do is you can go through -- and you're good at it, and so is the other side. You know, you go through the cases and you draw the line here, there, and the other place. And I'm trying to abstract from that in a very basic way for this reason. I think Plessy v. Ferguson was a case that certainly should have been overruled. It certainly should have been overruled because it was basic, because it was a right to treat people equally, and there were millions of people who were not. Now, you see the level of abstraction I'm working at? Now, if I put that same level of abstraction here, I see the following: You will go out this door, and you will buy hundreds of things, if not thousands, where money will go from your pocket into the hands of people, including many government people, who will spend it on things you disagree with. I don't see anything too basic in the lines you're drawing there. The second thing is, what you said was -- and it's true -- employees can say what they want. We're talking about six people in a room bargaining Alderson Reporting Company about wages, hours, and working conditions. That's pretty far removed from the heart of the First Amendment, and pretty close to ordinary physical activity carried on through words. Regulation, if you like.
