In other words, you know, I give it to my wife, I give it to my best friend, and I'm really in a position where I'm controlling the use of the firearm.

So I start with that and say what you're worried about here -- of course, he doesn't have any possession of it.  You have possession of it.  And what he wants to do is he wants to put it somewhere so he can't get ahold of it as long as the law prevents him from having it.  And you took it from him.  You made him give it to him. So what's wrong with his saying, you go give it to somebody?  Now, if it's too much trouble, the judge can say he can't make you go to a lot of trouble. If it's giving it to somebody who might really do everything he wants, we'll guard against that.  That's the job of the district judge.  End of case.

He can say, Use the gun.  He can say, Keep the gun in your closet.  He can say, Sell it to Person A or Person B or Person C. He has total freedom over it.

I think what Justice Kagan is saying, it's -- it's a lot harder to say you have dominion and control when you have to come before an equity court and say, Please, may I, you know -- please may I have -- have the gun given to my best friend or to somebody else.

I mean, it could be sold -- you don't want it sold to somebody who's going to do his bidding every five minutes.  I mean, maybe he'd even agree with that. And that now you're taking the opposite extreme.  You're saying the only way to administer this, is the only thing really you can do with it, is you can sell it to a Federal -- through a Federal firearms dealer.  And there are probably intermediate positions. Alderson Reporting Company You know, I mean, somebody has a very valuable antique weapon the Normans used to shoot or something.  And he says, I don't want to sell it.  I'm going to be able to possess it again in ten years.  They'll forgive me for whatever it is, and maybe you should accommodate that, or maybe you shouldn't. I have no feeling for how important it is to have an absolute rule.  You've given some good reasons for it.  What am I supposed to do?  Just say everybody agrees here you can't sell it your best friend who will keep it to you, so they're wrong on that rule.  The government's position's is now let's do something else with it.
