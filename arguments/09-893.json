That is different than rules that are looking at procedures and setting uniform procedures in both. How do we draw the line between a law that says discovery has to happen in arbitration, and one that says a -- in a contract of adhesion, if the superior party retains the right to do discovery but tells the inferior party, you can't?

And here what they've done is they have listed the four characteristics from Discover Bank, and they've said all contracts to do with litigation have to satisfy those four. At which point I think Justice Kagan said, so what if they've never done this before? They sure have done it now.

That applies whether there is an arbitration clause or not an arbitration clause. Now, that would seem to me no subterfuge. It is absolutely clear. They are not lying. It just happens to prevent arbitration. And he says that's absolutely true of this one, that once you get into class actions you will discover you have something that really looks like a court case. You have to have discovery, you have dozens of lawyers involved, you have depositions, you are running off every 5 minutes to the judge or to somebody to say is this deposition good, bad or indifferent. You have methods for enforcing the deposition. You have all kinds of things. He can make a much bigger list than me.
