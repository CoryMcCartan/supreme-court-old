I don't know why their determination about how to allocate who has to collect the rates, and whether they can pass them on or not makes it an impermissible interpretation of what's unjust or unreasonable under 201."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":7,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Are rate making regulations issued under 201, do they purport to be the FCC's definition of what is just and reasonable compensation?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":7,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"They are issued under 201."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":7,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"So they are an interpretation of the statutory language in 201."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":7,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"And you say this one is not."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"When you say it was always thought of as being triggered by 276, did the FCC reference 201 in issuing its determination that a failure to follow these regulations was unjust and unreasonable?"},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":8,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Suppose it issued the regulation after notice and comment, and said -- violation of the pay phone order is an unjust and unreasonable practice, would the case be different?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":9,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"You haven't. Maybe -- if this doesn't clarify it. I think everyone has about the same question. You have a bunch of pay phone operators. And if the AT&T were charging them too much, I think everybody would say that the FCC can say, hey, that's too much. You owe them 2 cents a call refund, and everybody would agree that the people who are hurt could go into court and bring a lawsuit and get the 2 cents. Right under 47 U.S.C. 201(b). Now, the only difference here seems to be that it wasn't AT&T that was charging, in my example, too much. They weren't paying what they owed. They should have paid what they owed. And that, says the FCC, is, under 201(b), an unreasonable practice. And, therefore, go in and collect it in court. Now, what is the answer to that? So far I have heard nothing that suggests that this couldn't be an unreasonable practice under 201(b), which is just what the FCC said it was. Now, what's wrong with what I said? I'm simply trying to focus you upon what I think is the question that's bothering some of us."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":9,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"So, my answer -- not answer, but my characterization of what you have just said is that the FCC did say it was an unreasonable practice. But in your view, it was not an unreasonable practice not to pay. And you want us to go back and second-guess, which we could, if their view of unreasonable practice is unreasonable itself. And I guess you would have to overturn it. I didn't know that was what the case was about, but are you saying now that that's the issue? They said it was an unreasonable practice not to pay this money, you think it is a reasonable practice not to pay the money. There is a dispute. That's what we should do."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":9,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Okay. Then what should we do?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":7,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"You say it would be a reasonable practice not to pay the money, but for the existence of the regulation."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":9,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Just like AT&T when, in fact -- or any other utility that, in fact, runs into situations every day of the week, where but for an FCC regulation, they would not be overcharging, because they have a way of doing it that isn't on its face unjust. But the FCC writes some regulations and now it is unjust. So I guess to take that argument would overturn, I guess, about a hundred years of rate making law. Wouldn't it?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":9,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"So in other words, you are saying -- I think it is common that the FCC might write some accounting rules, for example. And they might say, before these accounting rules, Mr. Bell's system in San Francisco, you could charge people 8 cents a call. But given the way we set up the accounting rules, we think this month you have to do 7 cents in the first six months, 7 cents, in the next six months, 9 cents. And any deviation from that is unreasonable. And the company does deviate. I would have always thought when they do deviate, they are behaving unreasonably, and someone who pays too much could go into court and get money back. Am I wrong about that?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":7,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Before you go back, let's hear about the accounting rules. What would they be issued under? Would they be issued under 201?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":7,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"It seems to me accounting rules -- in order to decide what is just and reasonable, you have to have accounting rules. So the accounting rules fit very comfortably under 201."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":6,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"May I focus your return to me? Because I want to take up with where your answer to Justice Scalia left off. As I understand it, you were saying that the rate in this case is unreasonable because the party or the person who is responsible for the use of the pay phone facilities is the person who's making the call, not the long distance carrier. My question to you is, isn't that simply a choice of characterization? Because another way of looking at it would be that the person who makes the call wants to use long distance facilities to get to the person he wants to talk to. And, therefore, the long distance facility in every pay phone case is using the pay phone in order to get the customer to what the long distance facility provides. Why then isn't it just as fair to characterize the use of the pay phone here as for the benefit of the carrier as for the benefit of the customer? And if that is just as fair, doesn't that end the distinction that you drew with Justice Scalia saying that it is not fair in this case."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":6,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"My question is simply, you can say -- one way of looking at this transaction is, it is the guy making the call who's using it. Another way is to say the long distance facilities carrier is using it to get the call to the long distance facility. If you look at it in way B, doesn't your argument for unreasonableness disappear?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":6,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"What difference does that make? What difference does that make? The use of the phone is of a value of 24 cents. But the value of using the phone is a value not only to the caller, but to the long distance provider who couldn't provide anything to the caller without the pay phone? Why isn't the alternative characterization just as easy, regardless of how they get to 24 cents?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":6,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Excuse me, but aren't you arguing with the 24 cents, as opposed to creating an argument about what is the proper characterization of the transaction?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":6,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"The reason is that the store that rents the cell phone is getting rental income from the cell phone. And in the case of the pay phone, the pay phone operator is going to get zero, unless there is some such scheme as this."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"It doesn't cover certain practices in connection. It covers all practices in connection."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"So you are saying that, putting aside 276, it would clearly be impermissible for the FCC to say one way that long distance carriers provide service to their customers is when those customers use pay phones; and, therefore, we're setting up this rate regime in connection with that service. You would say that would be outside the scope of 201(a)?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":9,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"That's actually -- that's, I think, your strong -- to me that was the strongest argument. When I finished reading it, I thought, well, so what. You know, I mean, can you see why I thought that? I mean, today's rule is different. It is true that you don't have simply a single telephone company providing service ultimately directly to the customer. You have everything mixed up. And there are a lot of inter-carrier things. Language covers it. Purpose covers it. Facts and circumstances change."},{"name":"JUSTICE STEVENS","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Mr. Fisher, can I go back to the first question I asked you?

Mr. Englert? "},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":7,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"What can't -- what can't be sucked in under section 201? I mean, once the FCC issues a regulation, it's easy to say that any violation of that regulation is unjust. And that's what's happened here. And this just makes a farce of the provision that says the only private causes of action are for violations of the statute and not for violations of the regulation. It seems to me if this thing, 276, can get sucked into 201 simply by reason of the fact that failing to obey an FCC regulation is unjust, that provision is a nullity."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":7,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"No, I'm saying you'd have to argue that if the theory you're propounding for this case is correct.

I don't think he's saying that if it is covered under regulation, it can't be unjust. Some regulations do relate to justness and reasonableness, but not 276. I think what he's saying is 276 established a scheme. It didn't have to be this scheme. It could have been some other scheme. Nothing in the nature of things says that the long distance carrier has to be the one liable for this. It rather was simply imposed by the FCC. That's fine. But to say that it would be unjust for them not to do that is just unreal, unless you're going to allow any violation of any FCC regulation to be unjust."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":7,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"But the rate regulation is -- is established in order to determine what reasonableness and justness requires. And 276 is something quite different."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":9,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Is it possible -- I was worried somewhat about, I think, the problem Justice Scalia raised, that old regulations become unjust and unreasonable. And then I thought, no, but tell me if this is right. That they're going to fall within 201(b) only if a violation is unjust and unreasonable. Now, we could say, and moreover, the FCC has to find that a violation of these rates is unjust and unreasonable, that is, it has to focus on it, make that determination. And then, of course, that determination has to be a reasonable interpretation. In other words, it can't just call anything unjust and unreasonable - -"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":9,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"And it has to focus on the fact that their doing so will create this private remedy in the courts."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":9,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"That that -- if you have that tough -- which I haven't seen anywhere, but I mean, if you had that tough a requirement, so they actually have to focus on it, it would tend to minimize the problem of a thousand different actions in ten thousand different courts and a big mess.

I would have thought your answer would be unjust or unreasonable has, for generations, been given a very expansive reading. And you don't need to say that the FCC has to do what typically I would have thought was a job for a court, which is to determine whether there's a private right of action to bring its action within a boilerplate term like unjust or unreasonable. I would have thought the contact point was what I was talking about with Mr. Fisher earlier, which is whether or not this is such communication service under 201(a), which is -- which is, again, I suppose, something that the agency gets deference on.
