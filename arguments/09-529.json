And the entire premise of Ex parte Young is that this doesn't offend sovereign immunity for a party to seek enforcement, prospectively, of a Federal right. So I don't know why it really matters who the plaintiff is so long as the sovereign interests that we've recognized, that the issue of sovereignty is one that respects a State's coffers and State's laws and we're not going to interfere with any of them, but we are going to ensure that, because of the pre-emptive effect of the Constitution and our laws, that Federal laws are respected.

What in the Constitution of the United States prohibits that suit from going ahead?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":5,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Why -- why is it an extension?

Why is it somehow a -- a greater infringement upon State sovereignty to allow a State to be sued in Federal court by a private individual, who doesn't even have to be a Virginian, for Pete's sake -- he could be from anywhere, he could be from Iowa.  And yet, it somehow offends State sovereignty more when -- when you allow a State agency to sue a State? I don't -- I don't see why that's so horribly worse, unless you're arguing that -- that it somehow destroys the State system of separation of powers.
