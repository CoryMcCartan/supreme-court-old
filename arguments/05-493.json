The listing itself didn't have anything to do, as I understand it, with the instruction that you are not limited to the listed mitigating factors. So, the concern is that, because the last reference was to the list, that the list included factor (k), without embellishment, and that jurors tend to give -- we have held that the jurors tend to give the greatest emphasis to clarifying instructions or later instructions in response to questions.
