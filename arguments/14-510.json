Minimal research would have shown that every other court at that time who had addressed the issue had required exhaustion. Now, we'll go later to exhaustion-when. That's a separate question. So how could you reasonably rely on a lower court decision that hasn't gone through the crucible of appellate review without having done any research on whether its premises were subject to dispute, reasonable dispute, and rely on that?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"But they raised the Alderson Reporting Company argument just lost.

You would not have encountered a time bar. Two years. But you, in fact, didn't present until four years after the denial in the --  in the Cherokee case.

There's a circuit split which hasn't been addressed anywhere in the briefing. Some of the circuits do it the way you say. They stop the clock and restart the clock at the end of the tolled period. In those circuits you would win. You could wait the entire six years plus however long the other case was pending. Alderson Reporting Company But another series of circuits looked to diligence throughout the period. And so you'd be asking us to make an assumption about which -- or make a decision about which tolling applies. You are taking a risk no matter what you did."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Well, let's go back to Justice --"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"-- Scalia's question ask you a question."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"All of these decisions, were they made with the advice of a lawyer? And I have a sense that the Tribe was concerned about its resources and that they were just getting together and talking about this and deciding, we're not going to win under the law, so we're not going to file. And it was only when Cherokee Nation was decided by this Court that they realized they had a Alderson Reporting Company viable claim. So -- but answer my question: Was there legal advice sought?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"If we disagree that that was -- if we think that was unreasonable, what -- your reading of what class counsel said, what would happen?"},{"name":"JUSTICE KAGAN","id":7,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"But it has not been found by a single district court, right? I mean, you're saying that that single district court should have had such power in the Tribe's mind that they didn't do the presentment. And that -- that seems an extraordinary thing. It's just a single district court. A single Alderson Reporting Company district court has no controlling authority over anyone or anything other than that particular decision."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":8,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"They benefitted, but the point is there is one court that says your Tribe can be a member. Your --  your Tribe didn't present its claim to the contracting officer. And so why can they be a member? The judge addresses that question, and he says, normally they couldn't be a member, but they can here because this is the kind of case that is attacking general practices of the administration. Alderson Reporting Company Then okay. Fine. You got that. Then shortly after that or maybe a few years after that, another case comes along. And the other case doesn't involve the situation of attacking the practices generally. It concerns the individual contracts between the Tribe and the Indian Bureau, what -- you know, in the government. And there they say, you can't have a class action. So you'd think -- and this kind of case you want to bring now is the second kind, not the first kind. So you'd say, why is it fair to let you bring this case? After all, if you'd read the opinion closely in the first one, you wouldn't have thought you should have waited. If you had any doubts about it, the second one would have told you you should have waited. And even beyond that, the administrator signs a piece of paper where they ask him: Do you have any claims under these contracts? And he says, none. So it doesn't seem to me you're talking about pure equities; you have very strong grounds. Now what's your reply to that?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":8,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"You probably wouldn't agree Alderson Reporting Company with any of them. But -- but -- but --"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":8,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"You're not making that kind of claim here, are you? I mean, you're not challenging the general practices of the government. Rather, you're challenging the particular contracts and whether you got enough money under them. Is that right?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":8,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"If that's correct --"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":8,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Well, then the fact that the second case emphasized the general --  you know, the general attack, which lacks in your case, is more reason for thinking that we better file our claims quickly because what had --  they held in those two cases are not going to help us, who have an individual claim. We better do what the statute says or the rules, and we better file our presentment to the contracting officer and certainly not write the words \"none\" when they ask you if you have any claim; am I right?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"But wait. I just want to clarify one point.

He claims that the only decision was on --  under Rule 23, and that presentment and tolling was not at issue there."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":4,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Well, let's talk about the American Pipe tolling. It would seem to me, as has happened in a number of litigations, that at the time that the complaint is filed, it doesn't mean that every member of the class has to have exhausted, because if that's what it means, then there can never be a class action."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":4,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"All right. So that Alderson Reporting Company issue is still open under the law, because it would seem to me, and I could be wrong, that if you still have time on the clock when the complaint is filed, that you can --  before you receive any remedy under the class action suit, you can present --  exhaust then, and recover, if you've done it during the period that --  the six-year period plus tolling. That's what some courts have done. They've defined the class as people who have exhausted, or who still have time to exhaust."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":4,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Well, this is a slightly different argument. You're saying they can't get equitably tolled for exhaustion of the administrative process."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":4,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Even if they could get tolled for filing a lawsuit."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":3,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Can you explain something in -- in your brief that would seem to make all of this beside the point? You several times referred to a release form that covered the years in question.

Why isn't the release -- they release the claims for those three years?"},{"name":"JUSTICE ALITO","id":6,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Did the Indian Health Service have the authority to require the Tribe to release those claims during the contract closeout process?"},{"name":"JUSTICE ALITO","id":6,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"What would have happened if they refused to sign the release?"},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"So it turned out there were consequences after all."},{"name":"JUSTICE ALITO","id":6,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Are there any circumstances Alderson Reporting Company in which reliance on legal advice could constitute the extraordinary circumstance required for equitable tolling?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":4,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"That it's settled in all circuits.

You don't think it's reasonable to give advice based on that ruling, that that might be an exceptional circumstance?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":4,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"So how about it's not Alderson Reporting Company 13, it's 12, but you're in a circuit that hasn't ruled.

Circuit said this is presentment, this is just paperwork, easy -- easy to do. But the Tribe couldn't -- if they had presented to the contracting officer, they just couldn't leave it at that.
