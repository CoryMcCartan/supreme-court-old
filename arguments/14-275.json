But there'd be no program if everybody said that.  So we have a rule against free riders. Now we'll give you what it cost you to take your raisins.  What it cost you is, in fact, the difference between what you receive given the program and what you would receive without the program.  That difference works in your favor.  It gives you money.  It doesn't take money.  So there is no compensation due. In fact, if we were to have compensation, you should pay us, the government. So how are you going to get by that part?

This is -- I'm having trouble with the same thing.  I agree so far with what the Chief Justice said. Go back to the New Deal.        You can, in fact, burn raisins, the point of which was to have fewer raisins, the result of which was to raise the price of raisins from $100 a pound to -- or a bushel -- to 400. That was thought to make the farmer better off, which it did.  And it made the customers worse off. Alderson Reporting Company Then someone had a good idea and said it's sort of wasteful to burn raisins.  Let's take the raisins we'd otherwise burn and give them to schoolchildren.  And maybe we could even sell a few, and if we do, we'll give that extra money to the farmer, too. Now we have schoolchildren with raisins.        We have the farmer having more money.  Sounds like a pretty good program.  Of course, you have taken some raisins. But what I don't see is how either the farmer or the schoolchildren are any the worse off.  And if they're no worse off, what compensation are these farmers entitled to? Of course, free riders could become yet better off.  They could charge at the higher price that the program creates, $800.  But, after all, that isn't the issue because you have to have, as a rule, no free riders.  And once you admit that as a rule, everyone, including perhaps these plaintiffs, are better off than none at all. Now, that's a very simple argument.        It's what I understand to be the economics of the Brannan Plan, the FDR, the 1949, et cetera.  And yet, we've had endless cases, complexities, opinions, and fines.
