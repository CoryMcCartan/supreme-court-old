We're putting aside the impact that we could have on foreign relations.

It is certainly true that, going back to the beginning of the country, there have been many treaties that have been implemented in ways that affect matters that otherwise would be within the province of the States. One of the original purposes of the-- objectives of the Constitution was to deal with -- with a treaty power was to deal with the issue of debts owed to British creditors.  And there have been cases about the property rights of -- of foreign subjects, about the treatment of foreign subjects here, about things that are moving across international borders, about extradition and all of those. But in all of those, until fairly recently, certainly until, generally, after World War II, all of those concerned matters that are of legitimate concern of a foreign State.  That was the purpose of a treaty. So can't we see something in that, in the meaning of a treaty, what it was understood to mean when the Constitution was adopted?"},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":8,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"If you had been the President's counsel, would you have advised him that it was unconstitutional to sign this treaty as written?"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Mr. Clement, there's an Alderson Reporting Company irony in what you just said, because the victim, many times, went to the State police and said, please help me.

Nexus -- nexus to a national concern, again, is what I understood you to say Alderson Reporting Company in your brief.  But let me give you a hypothetical, and you tell me whether your test meets it. Let's say it's the same convention, except it relates only to Sarin gas, and -- and there's a chemist out there and -- you know, the -- the implementing legislation mirrors the convention. There's a chemist out there who manufactures Sarin gas -- I take it it's pretty easy to manufacture -- and sends it through the ducts of a house and kills everybody in it. Does that have a nexus to national concerns?"},{"name":"JUSTICE KAGAN","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"So -- but this is -- in my hypothetical -- and you didn't run away from it at all; I applaud that.  In my hypothetical, it's a completely domestic use -- you know, it's just this chemist didn't like his neighbor and used Sarin gas.  And you're saying that the difference is, well, what the treaty makers did was define the category of chemicals more broadly. And I guess what I want to know is you are imagining a world in which judges day to day try to get inside the head of treaty makers to think about -- you know, in this case, we understand that there's a national interest in regulating Sarin gas, but we don't think that there's a sufficient national interest in regulating some other chemical or some other chemical or so on down the line. It seems to me a completely indeterminate test and one that would have judges take the place of treaty makers, in terms of deciding what is in the national and international interest."},{"name":"JUSTICE ALITO","id":7,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"And do you think it would be difficult --"},{"name":"JUSTICE ALITO","id":7,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Do you think it would be difficult for a judge to ask, is there any possibility that there is any other country in the world that has the slightest interest in how the United States or any of its subdivisions deals with the particular situation that's involved in this case?"},{"name":"JUSTICE ALITO","id":7,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Do you think that would be beyond the -- that would be beyond the ability of Federal judges when they -- when a case like this comes before them?"},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":8,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Is it -- is it one way to characterize your argument or is it too unfairly confining to your argument to say that what you're suggesting is something like a clear statement rule, that, if the treaty intends nation states to have their own constitutional structure superseded at a minimum, it has to say so, and then we will come to the question of whether or not they can do it?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":6,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Mr. Clement, I -- I don't understand how -- how you distinguish Sarin gas.

And I think the United Nations could well say, look, we don't want treaty parties to have to deal with whether it's somebody in this State or somebody in that province who has the authority, so every signatory must have the authority.

It seems to me there -- there's a lot of daylight between the two.  Let's take -- and I pick this example, not because it's controversial, but because it relates to an area where the Federal government has never been thought to have authority, namely family law. There are no -- you know, Federal marriage, Federal divorce, Federal adoption.  It's all been State law.  Let's assume that an international treaty is approved by two-thirds of the Senate and the president which requires States to -- to approve same-sex marriage.  All right? Now, if -- if that were a self-executing treaty, same-sex marriage would have to be approved by every State.  If it is not self-executing, however, it will be up to Congress to produce that result, and Congress would do it or could do it at least by having a Federal marriage law.  And then you would have to have a Federal divorce law and, I suppose, a Federal adoption law. I think there is a big difference between Alderson Reporting Company just doing it through a self-executing treaty and dragging the Congress into -- into areas where it has never been before. I think there is daylight between the treaty and requiring the treaty to be implemented in the fashion that -- that you assert is necessary here."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":6,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"I don't think it has to be the case.  I think there -- there's a great difference Alderson Reporting Company between requiring the states, by a self-executing treaty, to permit same-sex marriage and dragging the Federal government or allowing the Federal government to enter into this whole field of marriage, divorce, adoption, family law, where the Federal government has never been."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":9,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"It is?  It is?  It is? That's the part that I can't yet get my mind to these dramatic questions of whether, here, the local police power or, in some other case, some other inherently State power make a treaty beyond the power of the Federal government to enter into.  It's a very big question. But I'm not there yet.        And the reason I'm Alderson Reporting Company not there is because there's some words in this treaty called \"other peaceful purpose,\" and we have to interpret those words, and the same words are in the statute. And my question to you is:        What reason is there to think that those matters on List A fall within those words?  What is List A?  It's infinitely long.  A few things on it are in Holmes' opinion in Peasley, a great case on attempted murder where he talks about paying a small boy to move a barrel of kerosene with a candle in it alit, so that it will burn down a barn after a few hours.  The kerosene is a chemical. He talks about a case where a person went to a racetrack and gave a horse a poison potato. He talks about a case involving somebody else trying to light a match, which is a chemical, and setting fire to a haystack. We can all think, sadly, of athletes, Lance Armstrong, at least accused of unlawfully taking drugs. I mean, why do we think matters of List A fall within those words, outside the words \"other peaceful purpose,\" even though they're unlawful? And by the way, did anyone say to the drafters of the convention -- I found nothing in this brief on the point -- or did anyone tell Congress that Alderson Reporting Company poison potatoes, drug-enhancing -- performance-enhancing drugs, the example that Justice Alito used last time, you give vinegar to a goldfish -- I mean, these are all chemicals not in the annex, but they are chemicals. And they are absolutely nothing to do with chemical weapons.  And why do we think that we have to get beyond that fact?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":9,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"No, no.  There's an easy way out of that.
