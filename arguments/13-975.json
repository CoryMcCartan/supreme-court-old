We don't know why they voted.  What -- what's the big deal of having a city council say, we deny this request for the following reasons:  One, two, three?

All right?  Let's say we issue that opinion, and six months later something like this comes up in some rural municipality.  Let's say they've got 1,000 people.  And how likely is it that the members of the governing body there, or their attorney, Alderson Reporting Company if they have an attorney, will be familiar with our decision in T-Mobile South v.

Why don't we take word for word almost what the -- what the court said?  What this statute requires is that there be a written denial -- well, we can forget whether Alderson Reporting Company it's separate or not -- describing the reasons for the denial and containing a sufficient explanation to permit the court to evaluate the evidence, period. Now, that's what the city has to do.        And if they produce something that's a mess because it's a 98-page thing of minutes and the court can't figure out what it is, you'll get a decision like this.  If, in fact, somebody summarizes at the beginning, these are the reasons that we have denied and therefore we do deny it, it won't be a problem."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":9,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Counsel, you -- you spoke of the -- the statutory requirement of a denial letter.

And I take it that the SG is really saying, no, Congress required Alderson Reporting Company reasons, it required that by saying that there was substantial evidence review, but that it didn't require the reasons to be in any particular form, and, indeed, there's a savings clause which says that all doubts go to the State and local governments in this area.
