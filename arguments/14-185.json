I -- I think as a general matter, one could say that given the vast discretion that the BIA gets in denying, that one should basically defer to their decisions in sua sponte reopenings.  But occasionally, they do it not as an exercise of discretion, but as an erroneous interpretation of law.  And there's plenty of standards to correcting that.  And so even for me, in sua sponte openings -- and I do understand I'm probably on a losing Alderson Reporting Company slope -- and I think that's what the -- the board is basically saying.  It's a matter of -- of deciding whether there was ineffective assistance of counsel, and we have a right and this is the standard we're going to set.  Lozada sets the standard that we're going to look at, and for that reason, there is equitable tolling. That's basically all they're saying, in my judgment."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":7,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"You're right.

I mean, is -- this is a case involving ineffective assistance of counsel when he brought the -- at -- at what stage was there competent counsel?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":9,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"What we have here is a question that we agreed to review.  The question is whether the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals erred in this case in holding it has no jurisdiction to review Petitioner's request that the board equitably tolled the 90-day deadline on his motion to reopen as a result of ineffective assistance of counsel.  We granted review on that. As far as what the Fifth Circuit said, among Alderson Reporting Company other things it says, it lacks jurisdiction to review the BIA's denial of Mata's untimely motion to reopen, and so it need not address the merits.  Now, it said other things, too, which tend to support you as going on this other ground, but it did say that.  And you read, at least somewhat possibly, you could say he did ask the board to equitably toll his motion.  And the board said, no, we won't equitably do that because it's not going to make any difference, basically.  You weren't really prejudiced. Okay.        Given all that, why should we decide a different question?  Why don't we decide the question that we said we would decide?  And if we're going to decide the question we said we'd decide, I would think the answer is pretty clear.  They did have jurisdiction to review it.  They can review it and say the board was right because they have a lot of discretion here, et cetera, or for whatever reason, because there is no equitable tolling, whatever they want to say.  I wouldn't guess that. But I've never heard of any precedent that would -- I can't think of one that would suggest that when an agency does something like this, requests equitably to toll, denied, appeal, that a court of appeals wouldn't consider whether they're right or Alderson Reporting Company wrong.  I mean, what -- what -- if we get to that question, is there any case?  No, because I thought normally, courts of appeals do review that kind of question.  You may have a weak argument, but then they'll review it.  They'll say no."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Well, but normally it's a -- a circuit precedent establishing a particular rule on the merits doesn't operate as a bar to jurisdiction. I mean -- I mean, they may give you a very short order citing the decision that controls the precedent in the particular case, but they certainly have jurisdiction in reviewing. For example, I mean, let's suppose you've got an argument that you want to overturn the precedent. They would have had jurisdiction to do that."},{"name":"JUSTICE KAGAN","id":8,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Do you deny that the plaintiff here -- that Petitioner thought that he was asking for equitable tolling?  Because I guess -- I guess this is very similar to the Chief Justice's question, but it seems to me if somebody comes in and he says, I'm entitled to equitable tolling, and the court thinks, no, you're not, equitable tolling is unavailable.  Then what the court should do is something like this.  It should first say, sorry, equitable tolling is not available. Now, is there a different way we can construe your petition?  Oh, maybe there is.  We can construe it as a sua sponte decision.  Now in the end that's going to lead you to the same results because we don't have jurisdiction over that, but that that's the proper order of things.  You know, first we'll say, oop, sorry you lose equitable tolling is unavailable, and then we'll do whatever construing we can do to see if Alderson Reporting Company there are any alternative avenues, and then we decide there are not."},{"name":"JUSTICE KAGAN","id":8,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"No, but there's a -- there is something, and this is what the Chief Justice was saying, too.  There is something that the court does have jurisdiction over and it's the question of whether equitable tolling was available.  That's a merits question, I have jurisdiction over whether equitable tolling is available.  I say it's not or I say it is; doesn't matter, I have jurisdiction over that question either way."},{"name":"JUSTICE KAGAN","id":8,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"It's not determining whether it has jurisdiction.  That -- whether equitable tolling is available or is unavailable is -- is not itself a jurisdictional question.  That's a merits question. And then when you decide that it's Alderson Reporting Company unavailable you can say, okay, is there another way to construe the thing, and that ends -- that lands you in a jurisdictional question as to whether you have jurisdiction over sua sponte decisions."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":5,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Well  it's really -- you're taking a merits first.  You decide the merits and then we say, then there's no jurisdiction.  This is -- this is what -- whatever the rule is -- as you recognize, is a claim-processing rule.  You -- that rule needs to be interpreted whether it has any give. But it's -- it's -- there's jurisdiction to decide that question.  I think you agree that there is jurisdiction in the Fifth Circuit to decide whether or not this 90-day limit can be equitably tolled."},{"name":"JUSTICE KAGAN","id":8,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"But you see there's a little bit of a problem with the way the Fifth Circuit is going about this thing, because what the Fifth Circuit has done is to say that equitable tolling is unavailable and the only time it ever uttered those words is in an unpublished opinion. And in all the published opinions it's just said, you know, we're construing this as something else and we have no jurisdiction over that. And what that effectively has done is to insulate from our review the determination that the Fifth Circuit has made, if the Fifth Circuit has made it, that equitable tolling is unavailable."},{"name":"JUSTICE KAGAN","id":8,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"He's definitely Justice Scalia.

One is whether there is court review of the sua sponte thing because, as you probably know, there has been a long argument for 40 years about the meaning of that first part of the APA in Davis; or somebody says, well, when they say there's no court review when you commit a matter of discretion to the agency by law, of course there isn't.  They're acting lawfully.  But Alderson Reporting Company you can still get review of whether they acted as an abuse of that discretion.  Of course.  And I think you can. on that. question? But I understand there are different points Do we really want to open up that big And as far as the other question you want us to open up about whether this is statutorily forbidden -- you say whether -- whether equitable tolling is forbidden here, again there are two views. Lots of the circuits think, no, it isn't, and moreover the SG thinks that, moreover they're having a rulemaking on that in a year or so that could encompass that, but it's secret. But nonetheless -- nonetheless it might. And -- and so we're getting into what's actually I think a tough question. And maybe it's cowardly. But I'm thinking why go into those two tough questions, when in fact we asked for the answer to a simple question. There are -- you have written a very good brief and I understand what you're doing and -- but I still am sort of stuck on this, which I'll put to you."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":9,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Yes. Alderson Reporting Company"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":7,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"I'm sorry.  I'm totally confused.  I -- I think what the agency is saying, at least in this situation, is there is no explicit command in the statute about equitable tolling.  There is a time limit in the statute.  But can it be tolled or not? There's no explicit command in the statute it can't. And so as a matter of procedure, which generally we give a huge amount of deference to the agency, it has, albeit in unpublished opinions, followed a practice of considering it in motions to reopen.  And from that practice, they're telling us, there is, because the agency has determined that, with respect to IAC claims, that they will do it. I don't actually see that much problem with the problem, but I do agree with Justice Breyer that we don't need to get to that question here, because we really don't know whether that's the view of the Fifth Circuit or not.  And if they find it or if they say it doesn't exist, I want to consider their reasons.  That's what we usually do. But they haven't really given us reasons, other than to say the statute requires it, but I don't see why."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":5,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"The odd thing with saying --"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":7,"spokeBefore":5,"sideBefore":"justices","text":"That's -- that's --"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":5,"spokeBefore":7,"sideBefore":"justices","text":"-- the Fifth Circuit Alderson Reporting Company was right in saying we -- we -- so -- so we're going to give the Petitioner another chance, we'll consider it under sua sponte.

So I think what they're saying is that if there's a -- if there's a flaw, if the 90 days -- if the 90 days is -- can't be stretched, then we shouldn't reach that same conclusion by saying, oh, but we can do this sua sponte. They -- they seem to be saying their exercise of their sua sponte authority is controlled by, do we have a rule that says 90 days and no more?  If we do have such a rule, we shouldn't be exercising our authority sua sponte to get around that.
