But it wasn't the only change that they made at that point.  And taking that term out may have had more than one reason, of course. So two other changes they make are, they put in the word \"any.\"  So the old statute just says \"offense\" and now it's \"any offense,\" which suggests breadth and expansiveness.  And the other thing, of course, is that they do all of this in connection with this Contract Settlement Act, which presumably refers both to civil and to criminal matters.  And it follows right after this Contract Settlement Act and suggests Alderson Reporting Company that it's following on it.
