There are very, very few fraud and deceit statutes that define the offense by reference to a loss in excess of $10,000. My recollection from the government's brief is that they come up with three. The fact is also that this provision, the $10,000 figure, was placed into the statute at a time when Congress was trying to expand the category of deportable, removable offenses, and it would be passing strange in that context to define the offense by reference to a $10,000 figure as an element of the offense which would cut it down, which would cut the compass of the statute down to three offenses. What is your response to that?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Well, once you get into the State statutes you get into the further problem of an utter and I would suppose unjust patchwork of statutory reference to which this would apply.

If we take your position that there are a number of statutes that mention amount, some as an element, some by this, there seems to be no rhyme or reason to when the amount is there and when it isn't, and then you have these unequal results within the Federal system and in the States, so when you think -- would it make any sense for Congress to have drawn the line that way if the State happens to make -- to have the \"in which\" or if it just has fraud and deceit with no amount?"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":6,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"But it's treating people who do the identical thing differently."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":6,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"But what you're saying is you're not denying that people who commit the identical theft or deceit or fraud will be treated differently depending on whether the statute under which they're convicted has this \"in which\" clause?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":7,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Mr. Moseley - -"},{"name":"JUSTICE STEVENS","id":8,"spokeBefore":7,"sideBefore":"justices","text":"Mr. Moseley, can I get your help on a question I really have difficulty with. It seems to me as I read the text, it is easy to read it in one of two ways: It involves fraud or deceit in which the loss to the victim in fact exceeded $10,000. In that case you would lose. Or it could be read to say involves fraud or deceit in which an element of the crime is that the victim or victims exceeded a loss of $10,000. You would lose under that also because it is not an element of the crime. So you are relying on a modified approach, and under your modified approach what does the statute say?"},{"name":"JUSTICE STEVENS","id":8,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"But the statute doesn't say anything about conviction."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":7,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"I don't -- I don't understand how you squeeze your -- your modified categorical approach, which seems to be a deus ex machina which is intended to blunt the government's argument that very few statutes would be covered by this. I don't see how you get that out of the word \"convicted.\" Are you convicted of an offense involving more than $10,000 if in a separate interrogatory the jury, though it has no obligation in order to find you guilty to say how much you stole, in an interrogatory the jury says, oh, yes, the amount was more than $10,000? Does that cause you to have been convicted of that? You are convicted of what you are charged with.
