There's a step down from that which is:        I don't want to do that; I'm just fulfilling my artistic fantasies, whatever you want to call it; but I know that I am going to place this person in fear.

One has to do with the state of mind and the other doesn't.  The one that doesn't has to do with what the person does.

What is a true threat?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":8,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"A true threat -- you've seen the definitions, the instruction that was given is similar to ones that are well-embodied in the law.  What you have to do is communicate a true threat, and a true Alderson Reporting Company threat is a threat that a reasonable person would understand to convey a serious expression of an intention to inflict bodily injury or take the life of an individual. Now, there is a second question which I find more difficult and that has nothing to do with what you do.  It has to do with the state of mind, and that is what I want to know your view about.  Because I saw nothing in the government's brief that says a person could be convicted through negligence.  Rather, what they say, and it seemed to me this is hornbook statement of criminal law, is that you have to know that you are doing those things that are the elements of the crime. So you have to know that you are transmitting in commerce a true threat, as I've just defined it.  And if you don't know that, you are out.  You are home free. Now, that I would say is Model Penal Code. That is Brown Commission.  That is every sort of statement of criminal law that I've read, which may be only a few, but I don't know many that contradict that. And so why isn't that the end of this case?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":8,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"He has to know that, and I will ask the government.

Just as if you go into a bank, you have to know certain elements for it to be bank robbery.  You have to know that you have a threat, you have to know -- et cetera.

Now, why wouldn't that meet all of the -- all of the requirements that you insist upon, knowing that this would cause fear in her?

And that's not the kind of standard that we typically use in the First Amendment.  The only time I can think of is in the fighting words context, because we typically say that the First Amendment requires a kind of a buffer zone to ensure that even stuff that is wrongful maybe is permitted because we don't want to chill innocent behavior.
