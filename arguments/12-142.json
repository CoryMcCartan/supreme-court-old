It -- it seems to me that in this case we are not really dealing only with generics, we are also dealing with brand-named drugs. And I guess the -- the thought there would be, in -- with -- with -- in this respect, as to design, as compared to warnings, but as to design, they're really all in the same boat.  In other words -- you know, they have a design, that it is only that design that's approved.  If they change their design there's no authority to continue marketing it.  They have to go back to square one.  And that's just as true of brand names as it is of generics. So am I right about that?  That -- that if we're just looking at a pure design defect claim, putting the warning card aside, where you are in a different position from the brand-name drugs, but as to design, don't the brand-name and the generics go hand in hand?"},{"name":"JUSTICE KAGAN","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"I want you to put that aside for me for just a second, and I understand that's a very significant thing in your argument to put aside.

What we -- something is impossible when a State law penalizes what Federal law requires or maybe -- or, where State law penalizes what Federal law gives you a right to do.  But it's not enough for impossibility that State law penalizes what Federal law permits. And it seems as though what we have in the FDCA is a statute that authorizes, that says, you can sell this.  But it doesn't say you must sell it, and it doesn't give you a right to sell it."},{"name":"JUSTICE KAGAN","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Well, that is your best case, but -- you know, there are quite a number of cases where we've really held when a Federal law permits something, typically, a State can do more if it wants to."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Yang? "},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Well, but it's a little different.  Our cases are focused on the concern that the State is going to impose on the manufacturer a different duty than the Federal government. That's not what's going on in a strict liability regime.  They're saying, we're not saying you should have a different structure, we're not saying anything about warning, we're saying if you do this, you're going to have to pay for the damage.  It's not -- it's not a different duty.  And I think that's what's underlying the argument that, well, you can just stop selling because you don't have to adjust how you're going to make the drug.  You understand that it's going to be the same as the Federal drug, but our system is, you pay for the damage."},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":8,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"How would you define the duty that New Hampshire imposed here according to the First Circuit and according to the Respondent?"},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"But is that meeting a standard under State law that your friend's argument says, that's not what we're talking about here.  The standard is the same.  It's just a question under strict liability that if you follow the same Federal standard and market this in our State, you're going to pay the compensation for the reason of -- you know, spreading the costs. We don't want you to do something different. We just want to say that you want to do the same thing as the Federal government, and then you're going to have to pay.  It's different than the -- at least that's how I understand their argument, which is that it's different where the situation says, yes, you can market it and avoid payment, but only if you do it our way. That's a different duty for the manufacturer."},{"name":"JUSTICE KAGAN","id":4,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"I mean, that suggests that there is an obligation of the Federal government.  If there is one, yes, there's a conflict and yes, there's an impossibility defense.  But if there's no obligation, if all there is, is permission from the Federal government, where do you get the impossibility from?"},{"name":"JUSTICE KAGAN","id":4,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Well, I take that point, Mr. Yang.  I take that point, Mr. Yang, but I think then you're -- you're saying something quite deep about the FDCA, which is that the FDCA should not be thought of as merely authorizing drug sales. You're saying essentially that when the -- when the FDA does what it does, it's saying not just -- you know, you can do this if you want to, but you can do this and we really think this drug ought to be marketed. So that when States take action as against that -- you know, it's -- it's a conflict."},{"name":"JUSTICE KAGAN","id":4,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"And that's --"},{"name":"JUSTICE KAGAN","id":4,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"-- and that's something I don't think we've really ever said."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":5,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"So without the preemption clause, actually, with an express saving clause, you're arguing essentially complete field preemption.

Twelve -- twelve tried men and few -- and true decide for the whole State what the -- what the cost/benefit analysis is for a -- a very novel drug that unquestionably has some deleterious effects, but also can save some lives. And the jury's going to decide that?"},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"I'm not so sure -- I'm not so sure it works that way because of the jury point.  They didn't say that yes, you can market this drug, it benefits -- you know, 99.9 percent of the people, but there is that 0.1 percent, and you're going to have to compensate that person. They said the risks outweigh the benefits, period.  So you should not market this at all.  And it does seem inconsistent with the -- the Federal regime."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Well, what do you in that case?  You've got one jury saying the risks outweigh the benefits, can't do it.  And then you're saying well, later, there might be another jury saying yes, you can."},{"name":"JUSTICE KAGAN","id":4,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Mr. Frederick, it -- it does seem to me, and I understand that there's a waiver argument floating around here, but it does seem to me that this case was litigated such that the adequacy of the warning is really all over this case.  There was expert testimony about the adequacy of the warning, there were jury instructions about the adequacy of the warning. In the closing statements that the lawyer gave, it was -- there was a lot of talk about -- that the FDA's decision to change the label, to show that the label was ineffective before.  So there is just all over this stuff about adequacy of the warning, which does suggest that this is sort of within the four corners of Mensing."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":10,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"I see that.  But I don't understand why that matters.  That is, the -- I mean, I was thinking just what you said.  I was thinking well, I -- I dissented in the other case, but I lost, okay? So I lost, I lost.  The -- the -- the point is that -- that you have a drug, and you say to the jury, well, if there were no warning here at all, then it would be unreasonably dangerous. I think, yes, that probably applies to chemotherapy, it probably applies to Parkinson's, it probably applies to all kind, but you see, says the defense, there is a warning here and it says how to use it.  And as you say, that would be not -- it would be despite or whatever it is, despite, not because. But it seems to me in terms of -- it comes for the same thing, lots of drugs would be dangerous, too dangerous, unreasonably so without a warning. Chemotherapy is what I'm thinking of.  But properly labeled they're not, and so that seems to be your case."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":10,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Because -- why?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":10,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"In other words, in this case, they have to find that -- that no warning -- there is no such warning that could make a difference, that's what they're asked to find?"},{"name":"JUSTICE KAGAN","id":4,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Well, how can that be, Mr. Frederick, because the plaintiff really spent a large portion of their case trying to show this, that the warning was inadequate.  So the plaintiff must have thought that there was a possibility that if the warning was adequate, the jury would find one thing, but if the warning was not adequate, liability would follow."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":6,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"The failure -- the failure to warn defense was -- the -- the judge struck that out.  So there was no failure to warn defense in the case."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":10,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Where is that?  That's -- I do see that distinction.  If, what you're -- but look, the complaint's filled with words about adequate warning, no adequate warning, no adequate warning, da, da, da."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":10,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Okay.  Now what you're saying is, is really what the jury found, nothing to do with adequate.  There is no warning in the world that anybody could have invented that would have made a difference.  I'll have to think about that one.  But in the meantime, where is it that that's what they said?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":10,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Yes.  How do I discover that you're right about this?  Because everything in the -- in the complaint that I've read so far seems to talk about the adequacy of warnings, not that there is no warning in the universe could possibly have made a difference."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":10,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"How do I discover that?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":10,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"The second point is a different point.  The second point is, look, I have chemotherapy, it saves 100 and it kills 10.  All right. If you have no label at all, a jury might find it was unreasonably dangerous, but once you put in the label explaining the whole thing, it doesn't.  It isn't unreasonably dangerous because of the situation, and they could perhaps wouldn't find it. All right.  Now, you can call that diminishing or you could call it adequacy.  Call it what you want, but that seems to me to come to the same thing and is different from saying, no label in the universe would say it."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":10,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"We're talking about what juries could find and that's what -- and I don't know about Parkinson's -- I don't know what these drugs are.

What's -- what's a factor?  The warning is or is not a factor?"},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":8,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Well, but that's -- that's not the thrust of your argument.

You say there is a difference between saying, you have to put on warning and you are going to be liable if you don't, and saying, you are liable no matter no matter what because it's strict liability, but if you put on a warning it's reduced.  If you are a drug manufacturer, you are supposed to see a difference in those two situations?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":10,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Well, but then if you apply this -- what is deeply bothering me in all these cases, and it's why I came up and said, the FDA has to tell us -- you know.  Because just what you said before; what you say applies to sulindac also applies to 12 people who will tell the Mary Hitchcock Hospital up in Dartmouth that they can't use a certain kind of chemotherapy. You see, you could in certain horrible cases find a very sympathetic plaintiff who really did suffer terribly.  And -- and -- and you are getting 12 people rather than the FDA.  So my solution to it, which you know because you read Medtronics, may not work, but it's the best I can think of. Now, what -- what -- you can tell me if you want, no, there is some totally different thing.  But what you are saying at the moment, what I do in my mind is I say, beware because it's also true potentially of some of these life-saving drugs and that's what's worrying me."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":5,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Just -- just to -- because my memory is failing me, is this drug still on the market?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":5,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"All right.
