I'm imagining that.  And you might have thought, if factor one turns out to be invalid, the reason that that's a big mistake, because the jury would have weighed something against all that mitigating evidence that it shouldn't have.  And what's something?  There would be a lot of evidence on it, so it took it -- evidence into account it shouldn't have.  So, I might have thought that was so. But when I read the cases, that isn't so, because I think it's -- in Clemons the evidence would have come in anyway.  So, if that isn't so, what could be wrong with this problem in the \"weighing\" State?  And the answer, I guess, has to be that the prosecutor or the State said, \"Jury, you look to these three things,\" with a tone of voice that really made them important.  And the jury then weighed one and two and three.  It didn't have anything to do with the evidence. Well, if that's the problem, California seems to have that problem, because one of the things it says to weigh is, \"Weigh circumstances of the crime.\"  And that means that's not everything.  That's not the history of this defendant. And so, the problem that existed in Clemons and in Stringer and in Zant that led to constitutional error  seems to be there in California's case, too.

Okay?  Then you have the jury weighing something that it shouldn't have weighed, because that aggravating circumstance was bad. I don't see why any harm is done where you have a statute that lists aggravating factors, one of which is \"heinous, atrocious, or cruel,\" and that is later found invalid by the State supreme court.  But then, in the weighing process, the jury is told, \"Don't just weigh aggravating factors, weigh all of the circumstances of the crime.\" Now, it seems to me that the same jury that erroneously found, as one of the aggravating factors, \"heinous, atrocious, and cruel,\" would also have found that \"heinousness, atrociousness, and cruelty\" to be one of the circumstances to be weighed.

Now, that what's confusing me throughout.  As I understood this area, to go back to what Justice Scalia was saying -- no, wait, just -- I'll back up to try to get you to correct my misunderstanding -- Zant is the key, because Zant says, \"Judge, if you have a 'non-weighing' State\" -- that is, everything's relevant but the kitchen sink -- \"the fact that the prosecutor made a mistake at the eligibility stage by including something he shouldn't is beside the point.\"  Is that right?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":6,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Fine.

Rather, you have to back up and do harmless-error analysis. So, the answer, I think, to Justice Scalia, if I understand it, is, Justice Scalia, you may be right, maybe all this is harmless, but we don't have before us the product of harmless-error analysis, because you didn't grant cert on it, among other reasons. Now, if I'm right so far, and if we want to straighten all this out, why not go back and say all three  cases are wrong?
