Let's take the Federal grand jury as an example.  Do you think there are complaining witnesses before Federal grand juries?"},{"name":"JUSTICE ALITO","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"A complaining witness, I would think, is a person who files a complaint, who causes -- so, under the Federal system, it would be someone who files a complaint and attests to it under Rule 5.  That person is asking that charges be brought. That's what it means to be a complaining witness, filing a complaint. Nobody -- no witness before a Federal grand jury asks that an indictment be returned.  They provide testimony, and they may want an indictment to be returned, but it's the prosecutor who asks for the indictment to be returned.  So, I don't see how there is a complaining witness in that sense in the traditional grand jury context."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"A person?  What -- what if you have three elements to a crime, and you have one witness for each one.  You see somebody sees the guy trying to get into a car.  Well, maybe he left it -- maybe he locked his keys in.  Another sees the guy walking around with a television.  It might be his.  A third sees the guy selling the television to somebody else.  There's nothing wrong with that.  Each one testifies before the grand jury.  Who is the complaining witness?"},{"name":"JUSTICE ALITO","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Well, let me give you another example that I think happens with some frequency.  You have a Federal grand jury, and you have testimony by an FBI or a DEA case agent, the person who has been working on the case, and that witness provides a lot of information supporting the charges that the prosecutor wants returned.  You also have a cooperating witness, someone who has entered into a plea bargain and, in exchange for that, is providing a lot of incriminating testimony.  Now, is there a complaining witness in that situation?"},{"name":"JUSTICE ALITO","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Which one is it?"},{"name":"JUSTICE ALITO","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Both?"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Mr. Pincus, you said -- I think you used the words \"the one who motivated the charge\" or something to that effect.

It says Mr. Hodges -- that's the prosecutor -- knew or should have known there was no probable cause.  \"He,\" Mr. Hodges, \"directed Mr. Paulk to appear before the grand jury and attest to the truth of such charges.\"  So, if anyone was the instigator, it was the prosecutor, not his aide.

And in addition there's this special thing about grand juries being secret, which, if you allow people who are annoyed -- and they'd be quite rightly angry. They've been acquitted.  They had to go through this process.  They want to sue somebody.  If we let them sue, you'll wreck the secrecy in a lot of cases.  So, I see a reason for treating the grand jury even more strictly.

Suppose I say, yes, I accept that, there's a relationship, but exactly what happened in 1871 is not precisely always the convincing feature for me.

The grand jury initiates the prosecution.  So, why do we look back beyond that? That's where the prosecution is initiated.  You're not subject to prosecution until the grand jury returns the indictment.

We have on the one side, you recited Malley.  That was an arrest warrant, testimony in support of an arrest warrant.  Then we have the trial, where everybody gets absolute immunity.  And grand jury is in between those two.  So, why should we bracket it with the arrest warrant rather than with the trial?  The -- the arrest warrant is certainly pre-prosecution."},{"name":"JUSTICE ALITO","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"And at common law, did any grand jury witnesses have absolute immunity from a claim for malicious prosecution?"},{"name":"JUSTICE ALITO","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Well, could there be --"},{"name":"JUSTICE ALITO","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"And could there be malicious prosecution liability for a witness before a grand jury who was not a, quote/unquote, \"complaining witness\"?"},{"name":"JUSTICE ALITO","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"So, you're not really asking us to adopt the common law rule, are you?  You're asking for a variation of the common law rule that's limited to complaining witnesses.  Or are you going further?  Are you saying that no witness before a grand jury should have absolute immunity from a so-called 1983 malicious prosecution claim?"},{"name":"JUSTICE ALITO","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"So, if I understand your answer, that you're not -- it's -- this whole business about complaining witness is irrelevant.

What would be the independent evidence that you have that would support a malicious prosecution claim?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":9,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Now, the court below took that into account and said:  You're only relying on the grand jury testimony to prove the conspiracy, and that's not enough."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Thank you, counsel.

I've given you a hypothetical.  He -- no doubt he instigated the grand jury proceeding.  He got the -- the U.S. attorney to bring the proceeding, but he didn't testify.  Could that person be sued?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":7,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Okay.

Because you said to Justice Scalia the fact that there's been testimony at the grand jury does not, if you will, immunize the person from suit based on other acts.  Can you go further?  In a suit based on other acts, could the grand jury testimony come in as evidence?"},{"name":"JUSTICE KAGAN","id":5,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"So, all you're saying is that there's absolute immunity for a suit based exclusively on grand jury testimony, and if the suit is based on something else, the grand jury testimony can come in."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":9,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"I don't know what an independent cause of action could be, because it is the grand jury proceeding that initiates the action.

But the point I'm making is I don't see how your position differs from the Government's at all, and I'm not sure what -- how you could have independent guilt proven that requires anything more than proof, than the proof they proffered below, which was that this police officer issued subpoenas and took other steps to start the grand jury's process.  And then you use their testimony at the grand jury to figure out whether it was false or not."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":8,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Is it different from -- I mean, I find the Solicitor General -- it's my fault, I'm sure -- I don't understand the position they're taking. I mean, I think in every case there's some evidence about what goes on outside the courtroom or the grand jury room, and then there is some evidence about what went on inside.  And I don't know when you're supposed to introduce what. So, I'm guessing that -- that whatever the rule is about when you can use what parts of what, that if you win, the rule about when you should use or when you still can use the testimony that's given in the grand jury room is the same as the rule that says when you can use the testimony of a witness at trial. See, I would have thought that immunity means you can't use that testimony, but I'm told I'm wrong about that.  You sometimes can use it.  So, then I don't know when you can use it and when you can't. Maybe you know.  You've studied this case.  I admit I haven't studied it as thoroughly as I hope you have.

I am going to go and lie and say he stole my horse. Next step, he goes to the grand jury or someone and says:  Jones stole my horse. Third step, he's in the grand jury room saying:  Jones stole my horse. Fourth, he's at trial.  Okay? So, what comes in and what doesn't?  And can you bring a case in the first place?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":8,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"I'm at sea.

He didn't think of this thing for the first time in the grand jury room.  The defendant thought of this thing outside the grand jury room before he even got to the grand jury, and he probably told somebody about it, or he could have, or at least there's the evidence he walked to the grand jury room.  Okay?  So, there's always something outside the grand jury."},{"name":"JUSTICE ALITO","id":3,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"I have the same -- I have the same concern as Justice Breyer.  And let me try to ask the question in a different way. Can you give me an example of a case in which someone would qualify as a complaining witness under Mr. Pincus's definition and yet would not have done something outside of the grand jury that would be sufficient to make out a claim of malicious prosecution? If that situation doesn't exist, then I don't see any difference between your position and Mr. Pincus's position."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":4,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Well, let's go back one stage.  Let's go back to an arrest warrant.  The witness -- and the concern that the affidavit in support of the warrant is filled with lies.  The affidavit is presented to a judge.  And I would think that's better than a prosecutor.  And yet, there is no absolute immunity for someone who lies in order to get a warrant, even though the judge makes the judgment whether the warrant should issue."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":4,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Suppose -- suppose we had, instead of a grand jury proceeding and an indictment, an accusation to begin the prosecution and a supporting affidavit in connection with the accusation.

We're going to begin the case, the prosecution, by an information, or I think the Georgia law refers to something called an accusation.  If -- if we're not before a grand jury and the prosecution is instituted by an information and there is an affidavit supporting that information, is there absolute immunity for the false affidavit in support of the information?"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":4,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"But you -- you cited a provision of the Georgia Code that seems to equate what's called an accusation with an indictment.  It's on the bottom of page 22:  \"All legal proceedings by which a person's liability for a crime is determined, commencing with the return of the indictment or the filing of the accusation.\" So, if the Georgia Code equates those two, the return of the indictment or the filing of the accusation, why shouldn't the immunity rule be the same for the two?
