One is what were they thinking of the word appropriate if it wasn't costs?   All right, I see your answer to that.   I'll think about that. But the second, which I think your argument Alderson Reporting Company very much depends on, in my mind anyway, is, well, don't worry, because there is a way to take into account costs.   So, if, in fact -- I mean, you know, it's a lot of money, $9 billion, and if you divide it by the population, you have $30 a person for a family of four of $120.   That's a lot of money for people, for some people.   And to say, gee, you couldn't take it into account ever, suppose it would have been 500?   You know, it begins to look a little irrational to say, I'm not taking it into account at all.   But you say, never fear, because they will take it into account when they set standards.   And at that point I read the thing about the 12 percent.   I've got the word \"similar source,\" which then can refer me back to the categorization of two things earlier, as they say maybe, and then I have, aside from that, hey, here's what you do.   When you're regulating you look at the top 12 generators and that's the minimum standard.   So they might want to say, hey, that's not right.   I mean, it's right, it says it.  But if you go to the bottom 50 generators, you're going to see it's not going to cost $120 per family, it's going to cost $1,000 a family.   And we have the EPA saying, we won't even look at that. At that point I begin to say, oh, my goodness.   Why?  Why won't you even look at it?  You Alderson Reporting Company could say it isn't true, but why wouldn't you even look at it. And -- and now the answers seems to me to be in that word \"similar source,\" and the classes and the subclasses.   Because were there such an argument, maybe the EPA could say, don't worry.   If there is such an argument, which there isn't, we have the power here under the statute to take it into account. Now, you know where that argument came from? From discussion and thought in my chambers.   Now, maybe it came out of the briefs, too.   But is what I say right?   Can the EPA take that into account, or do they have to just blindly say, if it's the top 12, that's for everybody no matter what the cost?
