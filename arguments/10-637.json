It refers to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in State court proceedings.

Now, there are going to be a wide range of people that that many might apply to whose convictions became final or just about final in State courts at different times. So, it's obviously always going to be somewhat unfair and somewhat arbitrary that it applies to some and not to others. So, what is the problem here?  What -- the reading of the statute on the other side says:  I'll tell you who it applies to or who it doesn't apply to. It doesn't apply to people where the last State court decision was made before the Supreme Court made its decision.  That's it.
