It seems to me that has nothing to do with this case. This case comes out of a State that does appoint lawyers, and the question is whether you, your client, should have from your point of view at least one full, effective chance to say:  Every lawyer I have been appointed, I've gotten 100, and they are all terrible. And -- or whether the State can block that from being heard in habeas, by saying, oh, no, we gave him 19, and the claim that all 19 were ineffective he can't even raise.

I'm saying maybe that's right.  Maybe he's not going to win the claim, probably.  But the question is, if his claim is in Federal habeas, I have gotten 102 lawyers in 102 proceedings and every one of them was absolutely ineffective, perhaps that habeas judge has to look at it and say, oh, I see, he's claiming he's never had one full effective chance to claim that his trial lawyer was ineffective because the other 19 were just as bad.  I have to look at it if I'm a trial judge.  Now, that's not a silly argument in my opinion; that could be a winning argument.

Would the person then be entitled to effective assistance of counsel?"},{"name":"JUSTICE KAGAN","id":10,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Even though now it's part of the regular appeals process?  It's just the way the -- because of the issues that we recognized in Massaro, the State has decided to structure things in this way?"},{"name":"JUSTICE KAGAN","id":10,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"So, now you're creating a different rule.  You're saying anything which somebody determines is appropriately raised as a collateral attack, even if there's been no first review of that question, there's no entitlement to counsel?"},{"name":"JUSTICE KAGAN","id":10,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Well, I don't think, as Justice Kennedy said, that we ever really considered that question in Finley and Giarratano because we were assuming there that all the things had been through the appeals process."},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":9,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Well, Justice Kagan's question indicates that there are States, as you know, where on direct appeal they can allow for an evidentiary hearing on IAC.  And as I understand your answer, is if that happens, the proceedings that precede the resolution of the issue on direct appeal, being probably conducted by the same counsel who is taking the direct appeal, can be conducted and he can be -- and the counsel, he or she, can be inadequate in the conduct of those further inquiries.  That seems to me very strange."},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":9,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"You're suggesting that there's no constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel on direct, when he conducts some supplementary proceedings.  That's very strange."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":7,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"You mean -- it makes no sense to me.  That happens quite frequently on direct appeal where a variety of issues are raised, and the court -- the circuit courts or the appellate courts send it back to trial counsel to develop the record further. Your position is every time there's a sending back, that stops the need for effective counsel?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":6,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Is that involved in this case?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":6,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Do we have to decide this for this case?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":6,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"It's another case.  It's --"},{"name":"JUSTICE KAGAN","id":10,"spokeBefore":6,"sideBefore":"justices","text":"Well, the reason I think it's relevant is that if you were to say that there needed to be effective assistance of counsel there, then I would have asked you, what is the difference between this case and that case?  So, that's the reason it's relevant to this case, because the difference is really just one of just labels."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":6,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"There seems to be a rational line between collateral attack and attack in the same proceeding.  I don't see anything irrational about that.  Right?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":6,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Yes!"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":4,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Would you explain to me, why don't we consider this adverse to your proceeding, because this postconviction proceeding -- it began and it began at the same time as the direct appeal, but it ended before this case became final.  So, it was the first -- it was the first tier because it was decided before the direct appeal."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Thank you, counsel.

He suggested Arizona is one of those few States where you could only raise this issue on collateral, and, therefore, you are entitled to effective assistance of counsel on that collateral. Then he would stop there, for statistical and for -- reasons, probability reasons, rather."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":8,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"What about not going that far?  What about saying:  In this case -- in this case, Arizona did give him a lawyer.  In this case, it was the same lawyer.  In this case, the proceeding was filed prior to the completion of the appeal and ended before the completion of the appeal.  So, for this case, this counts as the one round of proceedings, and, therefore, his client can in fact assert that that single individual who was his lawyer was incompetent in those proceedings that ended -- didn't end prior to the termination of the appeal, ended first."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":8,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"No, but it didn't face the issue of what about a claim that you have a constitutional right to bring up at least once?  And this is the first time he was able to bring it up.  So in other words, Coleman didn't face this problem.  It's as if you couldn't bring up the claim that the judge was sleeping until you got to collateral proceedings.  A State could have such a rule.  I don't know why they would, but they could.  But if they did, it would be your first chance ever to attack that trial process, and so isn't Coleman, in its effort to bar relitigation, actually rather beside the point?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":8,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"No."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":8,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"No, no, we're saying it the same way, just as if his lawyer, when he could raise the fact that the judge was sleeping, didn't raise it because he was staring at the ceiling and had been drinking too much.  Just as he could raise that point in habeas, because it's his first chance to do it, so he could raise the point that the lawyer, the first time that he had the chance to raise the ineffectiveness of trial counsel, was incompetent, et cetera."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":7,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"What you haven't told me is a reason why he shouldn't have had effective counsel in the first postconviction proceeding?  I mean, our entire line of cases under Douglas were premised on the fact that defendants would not be or couldn't be charged with the ability to prosecute their claims through direct appeal.  Discretionary appeal, we said the likelihood is they could do it on discretionary appeal because they would have a record from below; they would have competent counsel below who would make the best arguments possible.  They could then pursue their discretionary appeals because they had something to work with. But if your first chance as to present ineffective assistance of counsel claim is a postconviction proceeding, you have no record to work with."},{"name":"JUSTICE KAGAN","id":10,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Well, but it is the first look --"},{"name":"JUSTICE KAGAN","id":10,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"-- only look at the effective assistance claims.  So, what would you say, Mr. Wall, if a State did the following:  If it said we're going to take out all Fourth Amendment exclusion claims, and we're going to put that in a postconviction review system, and, you know what, there you're not entitled to an effective lawyer -- would that be all right?"},{"name":"JUSTICE KAGAN","id":10,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Well, I'm sure the State would not say it was acting arbitrarily in my example. The State would say there's a good reason for it: Fourth Amendment exclusion claims are disfavored; they have nothing to do with innocence; they involve a kind of fact-intensive inquiry that is better done in a different proceeding. So, I think that the State would have many good reasons, but, you know, it's also true that there you don't get a lawyer."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":7,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"You've now told me that the vast majority of States -- 47, I think, is the number you gave -- put this into postconviction -- give counsel at postconviction review."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":7,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Isn't it an empty promise if what you're giving is incompetent counsel?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":7,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"I mean, it's a -- Strickland is a very high standard."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Thank you, counsel.
