That’s -- that’s the way we’ve rationalized these cases.  It seems a little odd to me."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Mr. Landau, maybe this -- this is a point your -- the respondent makes.  Prima Paint talks about section 4 and it says, with respect to matters within the jurisdiction of the Federal courts.  So the answer to everything you said could be,  fine, if this were proceeding in, say, the Southern District of Florida, but it’s in a State court.  And Prima Paint just spoke about procedure in Federal court."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"What -- what’s wrong with the argument that when you’re dealing with a void contract, as opposed to a voidable one, that the State policy is that you don’t enforce any aspect of it?  I mean, if you and I had, you know, a contract for murder and it had an arbitration clause, it’s pretty strange to send that to an arbitrator and enforce part of that contract as opposed to saying that the contract as a whole is void."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"But we don’t do that with other provisions of void contracts.  I mean, if our contract had a liquidated damages clause -- if you didn’t go ahead and murder somebody, you’d owe me $1,000 -- we don’t say, well, that part is enforceable  even if the contract as a whole is not enforceable.  We treat it as a whole.  Because the subject matter of the contract is illegal ab initio, the whole contract is -- is void and illegal."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":5,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Of course, you could say the same thing about a voidable contract.  You could say, you know, the whole contract is voidable."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":5,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"I mean, in -- in that respect, a contract that’s void is no different from a contract that’s voidable."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"You also run into a problem with the -- some States classify a contract as voidable and other States for that same ground make it void.  So at least you would have -- you would lose the uniformity if you’ve made the distinction between those two."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Do we usually -- do we usually ask arbitrators to enforce broader notions of public policy as opposed to the specific agreements  of the party?  In other words, if the reason the contract is void or voidable has to do with broad State public policy, do we -- what -- what’s this -- the best you case you have for the notion that arbitrators enforce those types of constraints as opposed to figuring out what the parties agreed to?"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"What would be the issues for the arbitrator in this case?  Is there anything other than was it -- was this interest usurious?

There may be dozens of other subsidiary issues apart from illegality.  They may say, well, once you determine that it’s legal, we think that we’re entitled to these damages or those damages or -- or the rate should be this or that.  Just because there’s a threshold issue doesn’t mean there aren’t other issues that an arbitrator might decide."},{"name":"JUSTICE STEVENS","id":6,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"If the case was one in which the merits issue you claim is basically the same as the legality issue under the contract -- but would your argument be as strong if it were different, if you had a different reason for claiming that the contract was void or voidable?"},{"name":"JUSTICE STEVENS","id":6,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"What about the possibility that you always want a neutral decision-maker in cases like this?  The arbitrator always has an interest in finding that the contract is valid and arbitrable because that’s his source of business is arbitrating disputes."},{"name":"JUSTICE STEVENS","id":6,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"No.  I’m just talking about as a general matter if we’re trying to decide the issue not just on these facts, but what is the better rule --"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":7,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"No, no.

I’m curious now.  Have there been any attempts in Congress to overrule Prima Paint?"},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Thank you, Mr. Landau. Mr. Bland. "},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"I guess what they would say is that there -- they insist only that the agreement be to arbitrate, and to the extent there is an agreement to arbitrate, they can enforce section 2, and the arbitrator can decide whether the broader agreement is enforceable."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":7,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"When I was working on the first options in those cases, I thought there was from Southland a pretty clear distinction between whether the person is attacking the arbitration clause itself. If he says that’s not valid, that probably goes to the court, unless there’s some other special thing.  But if what he’s doing is attacking the rest of the contract as illegal, that doesn’t.  That goes to the arbitrator. Now, I really did think that was the law. And even if I was wrong in thinking that was the law, it seems to me the whole community, the whole business community in the United States thinks it’s the law. Everybody else thinks it’s the law, and the briefs on  your side don’t even say that it isn’t the law, except for yours.  They say go and overrule the cases that make it the law."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":7,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"I mean, logically you’re right.  I accept all that you’re saying logically.  You could make those distinctions, but you also could come out the other way logically.  And so to expose to you what’s really bothering me about the case are two things. One, I think you’re worried about consumer contracts, and there are a lot of good arguments on your side. But this rule also applies to business contracts, and there what’s bothering me is that -- that the whole business community seems to have developed an arbitration system throughout the world that depends upon the distinction I just made.  And if we decide for you, we’re going to throw a large section of those contracts back into the laws of the 50 States and arbitration will be seriously injured as the commercial community has come to rely on it.  Now, that’s what’s worrying me because I wouldn’t want to reach a decision, in the absence of it being clear anyway, that would make a significant negative difference to the gross national product of the United States, for example."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":7,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"I’m putting it dramatically because I want to get your --"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":5,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Every usury case, for example.

These -- these are classifications that States make.  These are labels that the State puts on them.  And you are introducing vast disuniformity if you say that the line to draw is between void and voidable.  You are forced into that because the Prima Paint case dealt with voidable.  So you -- that you -- you are drawing a line between void and voidable which shifts from State to State."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"But almost every State --"},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"-- almost ever State will -- has an exception for contracts that are void  against public policy.  And it’s just left to the creativity of the lawyer in any given case to explain why a particular contract is contrary to public policy. And you would allow that to be shifted from the arbitrators to court presumably based simply on an allegation, well, the contract is void, it’s against public policy."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":4,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"But if you open the door -- if you open the door -- public policy has been called an unruly horse.  All you have to do is open the door and you will have litigation in court, and then the court will decide what the arbitrator would other -- otherwise decide."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":4,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"You’re giving the end result.  How many cases have the lawyers gone into court and said, court, strike down this contract because it’s against public policy?

If you want to read it the way you’re reading it, you say a written provision in a contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce. You say that has to be a -- a contract that is a valid contract. Well, what do you do about the end of section 2 which says, shall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract?  That would apply to -- to contracts that are not -- not void but voidable."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":5,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"So Southland was wrong."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":5,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Why?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":5,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Why would you make that -- that weird distinction --"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":5,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"-- and treat the first part of it as though it applies across the board to the entire contract, but the last part of it, reading it differently?  I -- I don’t understand that."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":5,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"It seems to me even if you separate it, you still have the language, save upon such grounds that exist in law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.  Unless you take that language, the reference to contract in section 2, as referring to two separate things, the contract without the -- without the arbitration clause and the arbitration clause alone, it seems to me section 2 doesn’t make any sense."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":7,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"It’s not -- the workability of it depends on how many challenges you get to people saying this contract is void, you know.  And if there  are a lot of them, then that takes a whole wide set of cases out of arbitration and puts them into the courts, just where they’re trying to escape.  And -- and so I don’t know the answer to how many, to be truthful, and I suspect no one does. So I’m wondering if there isn’t another route to the problem you’re getting at, which is, as I think in other countries, you say there’s a doctrine of kompetenz-kompetenz.  You know that?  You know what I’m thinking of?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":7,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"It’s arbitration generally. They don’t even look to see whether people agreed about the arbitration clause.  It says arbitration.  It goes to arbitration regardless. Now, the safeguard is, A, maybe the arbitrator will get it right or, B, if the arbitrator doesn’t get it right, they have to come to court to enforce it.  And at that point, you could say, you know, this arbitrator is out to lunch.  Our cases say he has to be really out to lunch, but you could make some distinctions there, you see.  And -- and if this is really a problem that arbitrators are upholding illegal contracts, that might be the place to begin to  -- make the distinctions.  Say, Judge, look at this a little more closely where it’s illegal, the whole contract, et cetera. What do you think?"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":4,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"If we take --"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":4,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"-- if we take, Mr. Bland, what you said so -- the words transaction involving commerce, but a contract -- okay.  So you spoke about void contracts.  Well, what about there’s not enough consideration, things that go to the formation?  So this contract was never formed.  So --"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":4,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"So we’re going far -- far beyond a void subject matter like usury.  But you could say there -- there wasn’t sufficient consideration. There was no mutuality or things that go to the formation of a contract."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"But there’s no -- but -- but why do you assume that that underlying illegality taints the arbitration clause?  I mean, take the arbitration clause that you would find in a perfectly normal contract, and if you put it in the -- the contract of the sort that you’re hypothesizing, I don’t see why this underlying substance of the contract taints the enforceability of the arbitration clause."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":4,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Are you saying then if this case, the case that was brought in Florida, had been brought or removed in -- more likely removed because there was diversity, removed to the Federal court, the Federal court should do just what the Florida Supreme Court did?  Or would the Federal court say, well, we’ve got our instructions from Prima Paint? It says excise the arbitration clause.  If that’s okay, we decide the other questions."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":5,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Doesn’t it -- doesn’t it follow from -- from that theory of yours that in every case you are entitled to a judicial determination, not an arbitrator’s determination, but a judicial determination that this was a contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":5,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Wow.  So in every -- every case, the person who -- who is being brought to arbitration can say, I deny that interstate commerce is involved in -- in this -- in this contract and I want to have a -- a judicial determination of it."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":5,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Well, I mean, that’s --"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":4,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"You said this was an issue for the court.  Was there an alternate forum in that case?  Was it an arbitration case?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":7,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"I had thought that the interstate commerce question was like Crowell v. Benson.  You know, it’s like a constitutional fact. And in fact, if you can’t -- if there’s not the constitutional -- if there’s not the connection with interstate commerce, Congress, at least arguably, would lack the constitutional power to tell the State court what to do in this case.  So it’s not as surprising if there is a difference between that kind of fact and the kind of fact that goes to whether the -- the contract is void ab initio."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":7,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Yes, it is.  It’s both."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":5,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"The question isn’t whether the court can -- can determine that fact.  Ultimately, if the arbitrator determines it incorrectly, you can take it to court.  But the question is whether in every arbitration case, you can go immediately to court to have that question of interstate commerce or not determined.  And that would really throw a monkey wrench into the whole system, it seems to me."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":5,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Once the case is in the court, of course, the court has to decide that question.  Once it is in the court.  And it was in the court in -- in Prima Paint.  The question is does it have to go first to the court before it goes to the arbitrator, and -- and Prima Paint doesn’t decide that question."},{"name":"JUSTICE STEVENS","id":6,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Mr. Bland, I’m curious to know if you agree with your opponent that whoever decides it, an arbitrator or a judge, it’s really going to be decided by the Florida Supreme Court in the next couple of months."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Thank you, Mr. Bland. Mr. Landau, you have 4-and-a-half minutes remaining. "},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":5,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Mr. Landau, I’d like to know  how you read section 2.  What -- what meaning do you give to a written provision in a contract?"},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"But State law -- the supposition is that State law provides that in this case, the usury context, whatever, you do not have a contract.  That’s the difference between void ab initio and voidable."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":5,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"I -- I guess that respondent uses the language in the way it -- he says it should be used when he refers to a contract that is void ab initio.

B says it’s voidable.  I void it.  I void it.  And there they say, fine, there was a contract and therefore this arbitration clause, which is separable -- you go to arbitration.  But if it’s void, where B doesn’t have to say I void it, I void it, you never had a contract in the first place.
