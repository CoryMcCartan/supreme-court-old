Now I got the second one.  Now I do have one question, and it's right related to Justice Scalia's, and it seems to me  that -- what he said, if I understand it correctly, makes this not too difficult a case, but you won't like it: That -- that we have long -- yes, it modifies law, but we have long, if we go back to the seminal case, Taylor. There is a Massachusetts statute.  It forbids a burglary of a boat, a car, and a house.  So what Justice Blackmun said -- I think it was he who wrote it -- go back to the documents to see whether he was charged with burglary of a house, a boat, or a car. So we have a tradition of looking back to the charging documents and maybe a couple of others to see what part of the statute.  Now, this statute is a statute that first penalizes many, many things, packaging -- packaging is relevant here.  What kind of packaging?  Packaging of drugs.  Okay.  What drugs?  It doesn't say drugs.  It says controlled substance, so you have to cross-reference. Then we look to cross-reference, and it says controlled substance means a substance included on State schedule 12345 or part B, so it incorporates that. So then we go look to those documents, and Alderson Reporting Company those documents will have a long list.  And we look to see here which of the documents on the list which is incorporated into the statute is he charged of packaging.  Very simple.  Happens it's not that simple to do, but that is absolutely traditional given our holdings on how to apply the categorical -- modified categorical system. So why not just do that right here?        Solves every problem that's raised."},{"name":"JUSTICE KAGAN","id":8,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"But if I understand the way the law works, right, Ms. Kovner, that's -- that is true of paraphernalia drugs, that they're indivisible with respect to the controlled substance. It's not true with respect to most possession statutes or distribution statutes or so forth. And the reason that there is that distinction is because paraphernalia offenses are generally extremely minor offenses; they're not felonies. They're just, as in this case, they're misdemeanors that are meant to catch leftover things that, you know, prosecutors plead to when they don't really want to charge a more serious offense. And so it makes good sense that all of these paraphernalia offenses would be counted out by this approach.

Indeed, the person would be deportable provided when you went through the State charge, the State charge was you violated the packaging for use statute, packaging a controlled substance, in respect to Item 13 under Schedule II, which they could say, anyway, and that happens to be heroin.  And if, in fact, when you went through Schedule III, Part 4(a), the word there was \"alcohol,\" then it wouldn't. Now, that's simple.        And if the State's charging practice is such that they don't tell you, that's equivalent to a State charging practice that in Massachusetts didn't tell you whether you were accused of burglary of a boat, of a house or of a car.

So we either have that problem or we have the problem of you have a general statute and which does it apply more to and so forth.

When Congress intended to say -- and I can point to at least three provisions -- when it wanted to say any controlled substance without reference to -- to 802, it said, any controlled substance.

And that eventually got to be impractical, there were too many of them, they kept changing and so Congress went to this approach.  But it was clear in the old statute that the only way that you could be held deportable was if you had been convicted of an offense, you know, possession or distribution or whatever, with a Federally controlled substance.  And there's no reason to think that in enacting this statute that -- that Congress meant to do something broader than that. There's every reason to think it wanted to do the exact same thing.  If you're convicted of a controlled substance -- of possession of a controlled substance, you are deportable.  If you're not, if it's only Sudafed, you're not."},{"name":"JUSTICE KAGAN","id":8,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"No.  But the question is, when Congress makes a change like that, which we know is a change for a particular reason because the list of substances was getting out of control -- it's very much like yesterday's case; I don't know if you're familiar with that -- but Congress makes a change for one reason, suggests -- does not make any -- any suggestion that this change is supposed to do something else and something much bigger, which is extend this deportability provision to controlled substances that aren't part of the Federal list, and there's just no reason to think that Congress did that in making this change."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":3,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Espinoza came out when?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":3,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"That was a Federal crime, though.

I mean, one of the strange things about this case is you have a disjunction.  A sock doesn't count as drug paraphernalia under the Federal law, but it does under the State law; it means any container.  And then to take that State law -- I mean, suppose we -- we have a conviction for one of those drugs that's not on the Federal list, just for possession of that drug, and then we have another conviction where that drug is inside a sock and it's for drug paraphernalia. So in the one case you would say not removable, if it's just the substance itself, and in the other case, because of the sock, it becomes removable?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":3,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"I don't think that's the important point that Justice Ginsburg's making.  She's saying under Federal law, this person can't be convicted for that drug -- that's not a drug on the Federal list -- but it can -- or the State list -- but can be convicted, under your theory, for possessing the sock and that non-illicit drug in the sock."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":3,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"With the -- with that particular unscheduled item."},{"name":"JUSTICE ALITO","id":4,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Do we -- do we even know that this is a -- a proper conviction under Kansas law, that the Kansas statute actually means what it's been interpreted here to mean?  The Petitioner pled guilty to this, I think, because he got a break, because he could have been charged with something -- if, in fact, he had Adderall, which is a Federally controlled substance -- he could have been charged with something more serious. So he pled to this misdemeanor.  But it's really hard to believe that the Kansas statute actually regards as drug paraphernalia anything that is used at any time to contain a controlled substance. Suppose somebody buys marijuana or some other drug and it's in a plastic bag.  So the plastic bag is -- that's one violation.  The person puts it in a pocket; that's another violation.  The pocket is -- is drug paraphernalia.  Takes it out of the pocket and puts it in the glove compartment of a car; that's a third violation.  The car is equipment that's used to store it.  Takes it out of that, puts it in something -- it -- it can't really mean this, but we don't have State court interpretations."},{"name":"JUSTICE KAGAN","id":8,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"If he had cocaine in his sock, he would probably be convicted of possession of cocaine."},{"name":"JUSTICE KAGAN","id":8,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"He was convicted of paraphernalia here because he had four pills of Adderall, which if you go to half the colleges in America, people -- you know, and just randomly pick somebody, there would be a decent chance -- (Laughter.)"},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":9,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Well, I would have thought the opposite inference.
