This is a crime that Congress attaches a 5-year penalty to if it's against an individual, which suggests that it is a very serious crime.

But the impression I have is that -- that I had thought there were what I'd call the elements of the offense, and then there were sentencing facts.  And sentencing facts have been traditionally facts found by the judge when imposing a sentence. Now, the majority of the Court in Apprendi went back into the history and said there is no significant old tradition, old enough, of -- of sentencing facts.  So, really, when you raise the sentence, that's like an element, and you should have a jury trial. Now, the argument here, one of them, that the government stresses -- and Ice is the same -- is that there is no -- the tradition's different where fines and where multiple and concurrent sentences were at issue. If you go back to the 18th century or earlier, what you'll discover is that the judge has always had a much greater role in deciding what theamount of a fine should be.  And, therefore, insofar as that amount rested upon some view of the facts as to the manner in which the crime occurred -- and it always does -- it was the judge who traditionally found it, not the jury.  So, those facts are not like elements of the crime. That's what I thought was essentially the argument.  Ice and fines are on one side of that line, and Apprendi is on the other."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":7,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"No, no.  They're not doing that here.  What they're deciding is a fact of sentencing is how often this crime was committed.  No one can go against the statutory limit, but rather it -- it allows a higher sentence when certain facts occur. Now, I thought in Apprendi that the history is just what I'm saying it was in -- in the fine case,but the majority says to the contrary.  And so, here it seems, even if I was wrong in Apprendi, that at least there's enough discretion here to say, look, this is traditionally up to the judge.

But I'm wondering whether this is different because here the judge was sticking to the $500 a day that was set out in the statute, and then the question is more, you know, of an -- is it an element or is it a -- is it a sentencing fact as to how many days theviolation occurred?"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":6,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Was there an objection at trial to the charge on the ground that it didn't instruct the jury to find the number of days of violation?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":9,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"You have no inducementto --"},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":4,"spokeBefore":9,"sideBefore":"justices","text":"But this was in the context where the entire defense of the corporation was consistent with what the indictment said.
