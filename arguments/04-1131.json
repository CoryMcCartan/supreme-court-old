It’s very complicated. This individual, even though he classifies it as a grievance where the union is supposed to take it up and the union tells him we’re not going to take it up, we don’t believe in your claim, that then he can run in to a Federal judge.

Leave the Constitution aside, but it might violate a number of practices, good practices, et cetera. But why isn’t focusing on that the thing for the plaintiff here to do is he goes to the union -- I’m just reading from page 6 and 7 of your brief -- and he says, I would like you to invoke arbitration? And they might do it. Now, if they do it and it comes out a way they don’t like, he then -- they might file exceptions and they might 1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 win. But what you’re worried about is if they don’t win or if they don’t do it, they can go to court only if it involved an unfair labor practice or a major adverse personnel action. That’s what’s worrying you, I take it."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":6,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Well, why isn’t it, at that stage if he doesn’t get into court, you then say that that isn’t true?

But there’s a reason for that. The reason for that is that these things can be very, very minor. So now you’re saying that just because of -- the grievance procedure doesn’t entitle you necessarily to findings, et cetera, that you can go into court. But the only reason you don’t get those findings is because we know, going in, that they’re so minor. So now the most minor things go to court.

I can understand the position, although I don’t agree with it, that the constitutional provision which says Congress can -- can make exceptions to the jurisdiction of the Federal courts should not be interpreted to exclude significant constitutional claims. But when Congress has gone to 1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 the trouble of providing for judicial review of any claims that are significant and just saying any other insignificant action, even though a constitutional violation is alleged in connection with it, if in fact it does not harm you that much, we’re not going to allow judicial review, what is -- what is wrong with that? It seems to me that’s what Congress has said and -- and you’re creating a scheme that simply contradicts what Congress plainly said."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":3,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Did any of them involve a 1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 -- -- situation in which Congress took the pain to separate significant actions from insignificant actions?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":3,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"I mean, some of them involve deportation and, you know, major -- major actions.

So I guess you’re saying, as to the constitutional claim, it’s obvious they have to exhaust. There’s no reason why they don’t have to exhaust in respect to the 12th test, which has already occurred, and in respect to the 15th, which might be threatened, if it does come about that it’s threatened, they can go in, I guess, under 705 of the APA and ask for an injunction. Any reason they couldn’t do that?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":6,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"No, no. What they do is they follow, like any other agency action. An agency action has taken place. I think it’s unconstitutional 1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 or you do. We exhaust our remedies and then get to court at the end of the day and make our claim. An agency action is threatened. I am threatened with irreparable injury. I can go to court, I think, at the time it’s threatened, and say I want a protective order. I think 705 provides for that specifically. And -- and, therefore, I’m protected. I can’t imagine why they couldn’t do that if they have a -- not just a plausible, but a -- a good claim that it does violate the Constitution and they need the protection. Is there any reason they couldn’t?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":6,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"No, they wouldn’t. Their point is that the very -- availing myself of the administrative remedy will work irreparable harm of -- in violation of my constitutional right.

I thought that you could do that, but I might be wrong."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":6,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Yes. And is there any 1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 -- reason that they shouldn’t be able to do that here? Because they are going to say that -- I don’t know they ever can make it out in this case, but they are going to say that my having to go ahead with the number -- test number 15, which, by the way, may never be threatened, but if it is, it will, the very fact that I have to do it, violate an important constitutional right that I need to have protected before undergoing the text -- the test."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":6,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Yes."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":6,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"You think they could not do that under 705. So there is a difference between you on that. As to the statutory claim, I mean, I find -- but others may disagree with this. It’s my personal view that the notion of private right of action in this area simply mixes things up. It’s apples and oranges. It has nothing to do with anything. That if a person, in fact, is adversely affected or aggrieved by a 1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Government action, he usually, almost always, indeed, can get judicial review eventually. But what you’re saying there I take it is that may be so, but this impliedly says no."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":6,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Now, my question is do we have to decide that. Because, after all, this individual may get relief through the statutory procedures that you admit are provided by asking for grievance arbitration. He may, the first time he asks for it, be given a piece of paper that shows him he wasn’t hurt. Or he may have been hurt, and they’ll say we don’t it again. There are a lot of things that can happen. Do we have to decide the issue today of whether if he goes to the union, the union says we won’t arbitrate, or they say we will and they lose and it isn’t as an unfair labor practice -- do we have to decide that issue as to whether a person in those circumstances can then subsequently go into court?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":6,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"So we have to say the easier matter is it’s clear that as to such matters, you must exhaust. It’s so clear that there is no reason for us to decide whether there is an implied repeal of the right at the end of some days to -- to judicial review, a matter which is disfavored in the law."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":6,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"I might. My -- so I don’t know why it wouldn’t be."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":7,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"But that was on the view that it was an exclusive remedy. The -- the statute is not written in -- in any way as an exhaustion requirement. It says you’ve got a minor grievance -- issue. You go through the grievance procedure. There is no judicial review at the end of the line. So you would be converting something that Congress wrote to be an exclusive remedy into an exhaustion requirement."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":7,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"So you -- you have picked one way to do that. You say go through the grievance procedure. If there’s a constitutional question remaining, if you haven’t been satisfied, then you bring the action in court. Another way to say is, well, as long as we’re making this up, why not allow the -- the action to proceed at once in court, but then the court to say, I’m going to abstain while you go through the grievance procedure."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":7,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Yes, I --"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":3,"spokeBefore":7,"sideBefore":"justices","text":"What’s the second statute?
