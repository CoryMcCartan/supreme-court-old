At the common law, it was clear that you're not liable as an aider and abetter unless you have a wrongful intent.  If indeed your -- and you acknowledge that -- that part of this depends upon -- upon wrongful intent, don't you?  You -- you say that it can't hinge upon the belief that the patent is invalid, but do you not acknowledge that you have to -- you -- you have to believe that you are inducing infringement of -- of the invalid patent?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":7,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Where do you get that requirement from?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":7,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Well, why just some intent? What -- what good does it do to say, well, you know, you're really not a bad actor, but you're, you know -- Alderson Reporting Company you're half a bad actor, that's enough.  It -- it seems to me that -- that if you don't know that you're infringing or that you're encouraging somebody to infringe is -- is no -- no worse than you're not knowing that the patent is valid."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":7,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Well, you have a cause of action against the person who infringes, right?  And it doesn't matter whether he thinks the patent is invalid or not.  You -- you got that person, don't you?  So this is sort of a supplemental cause of action against -- against somebody who induces, who aids and abets."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":7,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"But there is a common law -- I mean, there -- there was a common law, both civil and criminal.  The aider and abetter was really a -- way beyond what it took to -- to convict the person who committed the tort or -- or committed the crime."},{"name":"JUSTICE KAGAN","id":8,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Mr. Werbner, suppose I have a product and I'm trying to figure out whether, if I sell this product, I'll have liability.  And there are Alderson Reporting Company two ways to construe a statute -- construe a patent; one is narrow and one is broad. And if the patent is construed narrowly, I won't be infringing it. But if the patent is construed broadly, it's not valid. Right? So I have two possible defenses, depending on whether the patent is construed narrowly or the patent is construed broadly. Now, Global-Tech says that I have a good faith defense as to non-infringement, but you're suggesting I don't have that good faith defense as to invalidity. And I guess I don't understand quite why that would make sense in the context that I'm talking about, which I think is a pretty typical context. But it would seem that the two defenses are so intertwined and so two sides of the same coin that they should be treated in the same way."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":7,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Well, you -- you could say the same thing about -- about whether they were infringing or not.  They could bring a declaratory judgment action as to whether they're fringing or not. And therefore, they don't have to gamble that they're -- that they're not infringing.  They can get a declaratory judgment.  So, you know, put the burden on them. Alderson Reporting Company Why do you do it for the one and not for the other? That's -- that's what I don't understand."},{"name":"JUSTICE KAGAN","id":8,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"But that really does get back to the Chief Justice's opening question, because you're quite right in your reply brief when you say that this is a tradition in American law, that we assume that statutes are constitutional, that we assume that contracts are valid, that's right, but it's because they really are. You know, almost all statutes are constitutional. And here we're in a different universe entirely, aren't we? Where, you know, you could flip a coin as to whether a patent is valid or invalid and be pretty close, right? It's about 50/50."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Is that a -- is that an historical development?

But the whole point of Global-Tech was inquiry was encouraged. And it seems to me that there's not a parallel or a symmetry between what you're arguing and what Global-Tech said. Global-Tech said, we want you to inquire.

I mean, even take a typical contract case.  Typical contract cases, somebody sues you for breach of contract and you say, oh, I thought that the contract was invalid.  It's true.  I would have breached it if it were valid, but I thought the contract was invalid.  That usually does not allow -- that's not a good defense.  I mean, if it turns out that the contract was invalid, you win.  But if the contract was valid, you lose even though you thought the contract was invalid.  And so, too, here it would seem to me."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":5,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"But as Ms. Anders made the point that in -- in the patent context, it's the aider and abetter or the inducer is the mastermind and then the aider and abetter is selling the allegedly Alderson Reporting Company infringing device to a lot of customers.

The next question is, are they liable for it, and that issue has to do with validity; a second question.

So you're in the district court, and you have -- let's say you're the alleged infringer or contributory infringer or inducer, so you say, number one, the patent is invalid; and, number two, if it's valid, it was not infringed. So in the court of first instance, both of those issues are discrete in the sense that I am arguing it's not valid, so no patent is out of it; but if I'm wrong about that, it wasn't infringed.  So though -- those are discrete inquiries."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":6,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Your answer -- your answer was really good or my question?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":7,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"I have forgotten the question.

It can go to court and seek a declaratory judgment, it can go to the PTAB, it can go to the PTO, it can do all of these things essentially to figure out whether the patent is valid. And those things also have the side benefit of getting invalid patents struck so that nobody else will have to deal with them either. So why isn't that the right way to understand this system, is that, no, rather than come -- rather than allow a company to come in and do what we don't allow in any other context, as far as I can see, which is to plead a good faith belief in the invalidity of the patent, that, no, we -- we say to them, yes, we understand you have a question, Congress has set up many mechanisms for you to get an answer to that question, use one of those mechanisms."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":6,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"That goes to -- that goes to rolling the dice."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":6,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Meaning if you -- Alderson Reporting Company"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":6,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Infringement is one thing.
