It flows from the principle in Nevada that the State maintained the sovereign power to define the jurisdiction of its own courts, which is also an important sovereign power. So if you look at that power, then you have to say, well, what is it in the Federal Constitution that limits or takes away that sovereign power? So that's, I think, where I'm left after Nevada. And now you have a whole set of arguments, but they require us, for the most part, to overrule several cases."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":8,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Well, I'd like to get your response to the second part of this. Because your --  I mean, I --  I do --  that's --  I'm finding that rather hard, and it seems to me intuitively at some level correct that a State like Nevada should not be able to give less sovereign immunity to California than it gives its own officials. So I thought, well, where in heaven's name does that come from? And that's what's bothering me, and I'd like a theory. I have --  all I have so far is this: Full faith and credit, two statutes, sometimes exist. And there is also, when you're giving full faith and credit, the competing principle that, if you have a policy of your own State that cuts the other way and it's reasonable and so forth, you don't give full faith and credit. And here, if you're following that kind of principle, the same kind of principles in the Congress clause too, you would say, fine. Nevada, since it doesn't give its own people the sovereign immunity, doesn't have to recognize California's because of the Alderson Reporting Company public policy it's following. But as soon as they run out of sovereign immunity, which is at $50,000, I think, now they have no reason, and therefore they have to follow California's law. Now, I raise that because it's in the back of my mind. I've been thinking about it. And I don't find in the briefs either that theory or a competing theory about why you can't -- you -- you see where I'm going?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":8,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"I'd love your view on that."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":8,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Right.

Right? There's -- one is I want to have sovereign immunity. I want to avail myself of sovereign immunity. And the other is I want to subject another State to my court system when I feel like it, and I want the choice of doing that or reaching an agreement with another State that we should all treat each other nicely. So on your view, the States are giving up some significant sovereignty interest. They're keeping one, but they're also giving up one. And the question that you have to answer is why -- why is it so obvious that the States would have made that choice rather than the other choice?

Now, I would like just two minutes on what's bothering me. And what is bothering me is I really don't see how Nevada can say, we're going to give Alderson Reporting Company immunity to our own State but we won't accept California's similar immunity. Now, that doesn't seem intuitively right, but if I look at the Constitution, I see it says this. It says: \"Full faith and credit shall be given in each State to the public acts of other States.\" California has a public act which gives immunity. Nevada is not giving full faith and credit to that. I think those acts can sometimes include statutes or common law rules or decisions of courts. So I say, how does Nevada get away with that? Answer: Because they have a strong public policy in not doing it; namely, the policy of they don't give anybody, including their own officials, that kind of immunity. If that's the answer, that answer runs out of steam at the very point that they try to give officials more immunity than California is giving. Now, you see how I've lined up that legal reasoning with what seems intuitive. But I have no idea, to tell you the truth, about whether there is precedent for that; about what that might, in fact, get us into trouble on; or et cetera.
