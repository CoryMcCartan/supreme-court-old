But I now have a better understanding of Mr. Landau's understanding of the text, and so I just want to engage you on that, which is: Look, Congress couldn't have just said \"except for purposes of Chapter 9\" because of this flukey thing, which is that the gateway provision is outside of Chapter So if it had just said \"except for purposes of Chapter 9,\" somebody could have said, oh, well, look, I am entitled to be a debtor under Chapter 9, whether or not I'm thought of as a State. And so they did it this other way, which said -- which attacked the gateway provision particularly. And then in doing that, they assumed that all of Chapter would follow in its wake.

And that a State -- what States? The States that can be debtors under Chapter Now, that's how he wants us to read it, and that means that that provision does not apply to Puerto Rico or D.C. But it isn't just that no part of Alderson Reporting Company Chapter could apply to them. It is that if you look at the first sentence of 903, is that what it says is that those States that are referred to in that first sentence maintain all the power to control by legislation or otherwise a municipality. And he says, what could that apply to? Those entities that are not in Chapter obviously have all the powers they normally had, but the ones that are in Chapter might not. And so what this Section is addressed to are those States that are in Chapter 9, because there's no need to apply that first sentence to anyone else, and therefore it doesn't apply to Puerto Rico, that first sentence. But since the key sentences, one and two, are subparts of the first sentence, they don't apply, either. I think that's the whole argument. And it isn't requiring us to really play that much -- you don't play games with the words. All you do is say, this is one of those parts of Chapter -- not all, but one of those parts -- that even though it doesn't use the word \"debtor\" under Chapter 9, applies only to debtors under Chapter I think that's the argument I got, and is that -- that's, I think, probably consistent with what Justice Kagan was saying."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":6,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"You got it?
