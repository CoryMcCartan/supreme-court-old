By recognizing a sphere of accommodation, in effect, I think the Court has said there is a sphere in which religion can be benefitted that does not rise necessarily to the level of government proselytization or -- or government endorsement.

Number one, as -- as your brother on the other side pointed out, there's got to be some determination made as a threshold matter as to whether this is even a religious claim or -- or whether it's just gaming the system.  So there's nothing automatic. Number two, if there are, as -- as there frequently will be, in the prison context important governmental interests which can only be served by denying the -- the request, the request can be denied.

I suppose the same thing is true of a church that applies for a tax exemption.  So I don't think that you could say that automatically that fact that they're going to give the church a tax exemption or that they're going to give the religious person some special consideration, that that in and of itself violates the Establishment Clause.
