You have to be -- you phrase it the other way -- you have to be more careful with respect to people who are simply being detained. But it's very complicated in a case like this because the Respondents make a very persuasive case that the convicts are actually less of a threat than the -- often than the pretrial detainees.

And in the Eighth Amendment context, we've suggested that that term \"punishment\" does indeed have a subjective component; that it requires some kind of intent to chastise or to deter.  So I'm a little bit with Justice Kennedy, that I'm not quite sure what the word \"punishment\" is doing in this context, but if we're looking for punishment, we have indicated that punishment is a subjective concept."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":6,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Yes, but you -- you -- you brought punishment into this discussion.  We didn't. Justice Kagan didn't.  Your brief is full of references to punishment.  You say it's punishment that's bad. You -- you want to abandon all of that?  That's -- that's not the criteria?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":10,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"I don't understand it, either.  It seems to me that there is some circumstances Alderson Reporting Company where a guard is trying to punish someone, but there are many circumstances where a guard has something totally else in mind. He's trying to keep order in the prison. A policeman might try to stop a fleeing felon. That has nothing to do with punishment. And so what a guard -- normally, the provision that governs the policeman is the Fourth Amendment. I would guess that if you're talking about trying to keep order in a prison, the Due Process Clause may have something to do with it. This person who may be awaiting a lawyer is there, his liberty confined, and you cannot use excessive force. I â€“ I don't see what punishment had to do with it. But I -- but I did think, and I don't know the answer, but I looked it up in the Model Penal Code, that either the policeman who's trying to stop someone, or perhaps the prison guard who's trying to keep order, cannot use excessive force. Now, what is excessive force? It is force that is objectively unreasonable. Now, suppose he does. The next question is: Is a state of mind required? We can imagine -- it would be a weird case -- but we can imagine a very weird case where the force is objectively unreasonable, but the policeman is totally innocent. Somebody told him, that is a Taser, but it's really a Alderson Reporting Company gun.  He uses it.  Objectively unreasonable.  State of mind, innocent.  Is he liable? As far as I can tell, the government thinks he should be.  As far as I can tell, you think he should be.  End of case.  We just say everybody agrees.  Is that where we are?  Because I'm rather worried about holding the policeman in this weird case, where his state of mind is a hundred percent innocent.  What here happened is that they read in a little bit of culpability, the least onerous subjective intent.  It's called recklessness.  You have to be aware of the risk. So I'm rather tempted to say, yes, there should be something guilty about this policeman.  Now, there's where I am at the moment, and I'd like you to explain where I should go."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":10,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"At least in a prison, I would think a prison guard would have a pretty tough time thinking that if this person is in prison because he's been convicted of a crime, I can try to control his riotous behavior as long as I reasonably believe that what I'm doing is correct, even if it turns -- but now I have a totally different standard, where this person's in the same cell, doing the same thing, but he hasn't yet had his trial.  He's just there waiting for his lawyer or he's been there because bail has been denied. I -- I don't see how you administer such a rule."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":7,"spokeBefore":10,"sideBefore":"justices","text":"Can I --"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":10,"spokeBefore":7,"sideBefore":"justices","text":"What's the answer to that?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":7,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Can I -- I'm still struggling because we're trying to create boxes in a way that makes no sense to me.  There are all sorts of reasons for doing things, and the Eighth Amendment cases that we have, have to do with punishment qua not bringing control, not responding to a prison outbreak, Alderson Reporting Company or a fight, or anything else, but the types of conditions that are imposed on prisoners as punishment, i.e., you've broken an administrative rule, and now we're going to put you in shackles in the dark dungeon. We've already said in one case you can't do that.  You may subjectively and legitimately think that that will keep you constrained, but that's too far. It's not -- it's unwanted and unnecessarily cruel and unusual.  All right?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":7,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"But that's very different than this situation.  Whether it's a pretrial detainee or post-trial detainee, I don't think the Constitution gives you a free pass to punish a prisoner by inflicting unwanted corporal punishment.  I'm not talking about the conditions of -- of punishment; i.e., good time credit, solitary confinement, segregation of some sort, deprivation of a prison job you have.  That, clearly, you need an Eighth Amendment, sort of subjective intent element. I'm talking about the use of force for purposes of restoring discipline.  That's what this was about, wasn't it?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":7,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"So I keep saying why are Alderson Reporting Company we thinking about the necessity to impose subjective standards or any other standards or that they have to be different?"},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Yes."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"MS.

But there's another potential game-changer as well, and that is this question of have you actually been convicted?  Has the legal system found that you're a person who is a wrongdoer? So if we say that both of these things are important, why shouldn't we adopt a set of principles that say it is -- we're -- we're looking for objectively reasonable conduct, but in looking for that, of course we take into account the prison circumstances.  Of course we take into account the context in making that evaluation, so that the person on the street does not necessarily come up with the same result as the person in prison because the contexts are different. But still, the test, the basic test is the same because they are both people who have not been found to have done anything wrong.
