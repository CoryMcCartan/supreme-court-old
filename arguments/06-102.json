Mr. Castanias. "},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Just on the second point. I wanted -- does the rule of the Federal district court in forum non conveniens where it dismisses a case for lack of a convenient form, does it have any ongoing consequences as the law of the case? I know our Chick Kam Choo precedent where we said Federal court determination forum non conveniens is not binding in a state court, but supposing in this case that the parties went to San Francisco with a -- and said we want to sue there. Would the San Francisco court, the United States District Court feel bound by the determination that this dispute is determined by Chinese law, and that the Chinese court is therefore the appropriate court?"},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"What about the ruling that this would be governed by Chinese law and that the Chinese court is the best forum to consider that? That too has no lat -- has no effect beyond the court in Philadelphia?"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Do you know any case, Mr. Castanias, where there has been a forum non conveniens dismissal in favor of a foreign forum where the plaintiff has then attempted to go into a different U.S. court to get a different resolution?"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Either one."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"You -- you were urging that this is a threshold issue and it has nothing to do with the merits; but there is an argument that the existence of personal jurisdiction or not might have some bearing on the forum non conveniens evaluation."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Uh-huh. Uh-huh."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"One question that doesn't even have to do with the issue before us. I'm curious about why we're speaking of fora, judicial fora, there was in this picture an agreement to arbitrate. What happened to that?"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"There was an agreement to arbitrate. And we're talking about a suit brought by one party in the United States, by the other party in China, and no arbitration occurred apparently, although I thought the contract called for it."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Thank you."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"spokeBefore":4,"sideBefore":"justices","text":"That's not an exercise of law declaring authority on the merits?"},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"In other words, the district court didn't hold that it didn't apply?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":5,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"It might have been the allegedly defrauded Chinese court that found that the arbitration clause did not apply?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":5,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"It might have been the allegedly defrauded Chinese court which found that the arbitration clause did not apply."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":5,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"I don't see how that court would have gotten into the act unless that was the case."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Thank you, Counsel. Mr. Hallward-Driemeier? "},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":4,"spokeBefore":6,"sideBefore":"","text":"But the Gulf Oil case does say that a forum non conveniens dismissal presupposes that the forum is one in which there's personal jurisdiction and one of proper venue. It's just another forum is more appropriate."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":5,"spokeBefore":6,"sideBefore":"","text":"It was not, not felicitously put. I think all the Court was saying was that there would no need for a doctrine of forum non conveniens where there is no personal jurisdiction. The only point of the doctrine is to get rid of the case where you -- where you do have jurisdiction. And so you do not have to -- but that doesn't mean that you must establish jurisdiction before you can exercise the doctrine. It is a doctrine that overrides the existence of personal jurisdiction. In that sense, it presupposes personal jurisdiction."},{"name":"JUSTICE STEVENS","id":7,"spokeBefore":6,"sideBefore":"","text":"Do I correctly understand your argument to be that, that in this case it happened to be the doubt about personal jurisdiction rather than subject matter jurisdiction but you would make the same argument if it were a doubt about subject matter jurisdiction?"},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"spokeBefore":6,"sideBefore":"","text":"Can a district court do both? Can it say I've reached personal jurisdiction, I conclude that I, we do not have jurisdiction over this case? And in the alternative be dismissed on forum non conveniens grounds if it turns out we do?"},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"spokeBefore":6,"sideBefore":"","text":"But not if there's, I presume, if there's an appeal."},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":3,"spokeBefore":6,"sideBefore":"","text":"In Martin, in the hypothetical where this case is dismissed for forum non conveniens and then they go to another Federal district court, could the second Federal district court say this has already been heard by the first district court; I'm not getting into it? Or, or does that district court have, have to go through the motion again?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":5,"spokeBefore":6,"sideBefore":"","text":"Now, why is that? Now - - to some extent this is a call for the district judge. There is a degree of discretion involved in it, and it's entirely conceivable that one district judge would correctly dismiss the case for forum non conveniens whereas another district judge faced with the same question would not do so. And both of them would be acting lawfully; isn't that -- isn't that conceivable?"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":4,"spokeBefore":6,"sideBefore":"","text":"Mr. Hallward-Driemeier, because your time is running out, there is a question about a court without personal jurisdiction dismissing on forum non conveniens ground, and that is, it's common, as you know, to condition forum non conveniens dismissals on the defendant's undertaking that the defendant will not raise the statute of limitations and other conditions. If the Court has no personal jurisdiction over the defendant, it would be unable to impose such conditions; isn't that so?"},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"spokeBefore":6,"sideBefore":"","text":"Thank you, Counsel. Ms. Higgins. "},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":5,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Well, that only proved that an appellate court can affirm on grounds other than the ground relied upon by the district court, even if the ground relied upon by the district court is also a valid ground. It's up to an appellate court -- - it's available to an appellate court, especially where the ground is jurisdiction, to choose to look into jurisdiction and say there isn't any. I don't know, I don't know how that adds to your case."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":5,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Well, you found one appellate court that chose to do it that way. Frankly, if I were sitting on an appellate panel I wouldn't do it that way if I thought the forum non conveniens ground was valid."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":5,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Yes."},{"name":"JUSTICE STEVENS","id":7,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"May I ask this question. We talk of course about the unnecessary burden on the litigants, but I wonder if there isn't even a more fundamental problem with the procedure that the Third Circuit followed here. That is, is there really a case or controversy down there? Does the defendant have any motivation to spend a lot of money fighting about jurisdiction when he knows that the case is going to be transferred anyway? Is this a real live controversy on the issue that's left open?"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":4,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"There couldn't be any question about the alternate forum taking jurisdiction here, because it, in fact, had. A proceeding was ongoing in China. So you brought up the question about the Court gives up -- if the Court dismisses on forum non conveniens and then the supposedly more convenient forum doesn't take the case. But that can't be a factor in this case, where the other forum was in China and was indeed litigating the case."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":4,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"I'm sorry. I'm not following you, so please straighten me out. I thought that the claim was that a fraud had been committed on the Chinese court."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":4,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Your claim was that a fraud had been committed on the Chinese court in connection with the arrest of this vessel and the ensuing proceedings?"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":4,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Now, why in the world should a court in the United States get involved in determining whether a fraud was committed on a Chinese court?"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":4,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"American law to determine whether a fraud had been committed on the Chinese court? It seems just stating it that it might be offensive to the Chinese court to have another court determine whether it had been defrauded."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":4,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Well, that was a very polite way of the Chinese court saying: We don't care what the United States court is doing; we've got this case, we've got the ship, and we're going to adjudicate it; and it doesn't matter. We don't have to say anything to the United States to chastise it for even thinking it could become involved in this matter. It was polite."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":5,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Well, why -- I mean, I assume that in deciding forum non conveniens -- that there is an inconvenient forum, the court making that judgment would assume that there was personal jurisdiction and would simply say, you know, put that into the mix. Assuming we have personal jurisdiction, is this nonetheless an inconvenient forum? And if the court can say yes, that's the end of the game. I don't see what you have to gain here. Suppose the Court does decide that it has jurisdiction and dismisses for forum non conveniens? What, what - - what are you gambling for here? I don't understand what's the -- what's the desirable outcome you hope to achieve?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":5,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Right, and the district court at best for you, at best, finds personal jurisdiction. If it finds no personal jurisdiction, you know, it dismisses for that reason instead of for forum non conveniens. If it finds personal jurisdiction, it would say: Oh, there is personal jurisdiction; but I assumed there was personal jurisdiction when I dismissed it for forum non conveniens, so this is really the same call that I made before. Dismissed for forum non conveniens."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":4,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Why would a defendant that has moved to dismiss for forum non conveniens waive jurisdiction? It seems to me that there is something in this picture that is to your advantage and that is if you can get the Court to say, well, we have to do personal jurisdiction first, you ask for discovery on that issue and it goes out on forum non conveniens without deciding personal jurisdiction, you are not going to get that discovery."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":5,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Yeah, but discovery for its own sake is no fun. What does discovery for its own sake achieve? (Laughter.)"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":5,"spokeBefore":5,"sideBefore":"justices","text":"Unless there's something at the end of the discovery. Now, maybe what you hoped is that the Republic of China would not accede to the discovery and therefore, you would get a default judgment or something. You know, I just -- I just don't see what's at the end of this game for you."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":5,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"I guess we should ask the other side, but I think I know what their answer will be, whether if the Court does dismiss on the basis of forum non conveniens without first addressing personal jurisdiction, it must assume the existence of personal jurisdiction? And what do you think?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":5,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Yes, I agree."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":5,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"I agree. So how are you going to get a different result then when it goes back and the court of appeals says, oh, yes, you had personal jurisdiction, just as you thought you did, whereupon the district court says, oh, yeah, same result."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":4,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"But we know that that's not going to happen here, because the Chinese court has adjudicated the case."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":4,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"We're dealing with, because it's a foreign nation, not the codified forum non conveniens that's in 1404 and 1406. And you are treating this as it were counterpart to 1404, which is forum non conveniens. But 1406 is wrong venue and, as you know, in the Goldlaw case this Court said a court can transfer even though it lacks personal jurisdiction and is a place of improper venue. Now, why isn't the forum non conveniens doctrine as applied to foreign nations a combination of 1404 and a 1406, and if it includes 1406 then you don't need your personal jurisdiction, you don't need venue, you just transfer it to a place where those conditions exist?"},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Thank you, Ms. Higgins.
