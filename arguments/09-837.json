Take the typical work/study program in a college.  That would seem to fit this language to a tee. There's a student, and the student is working part time, but you are -- there -- there is no independent significance to the term \"student\" as you read the text; that is, the student and the services are all together.  It's not, \"I am a student here and I perform services there.\"  It's -- the student is -- the education is the service."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":2,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"But wouldn't -- wouldn't this fit the work/study student who is studying philosophy and then he's working in the, say, speech department?"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":2,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"The -- it seems to me that -- what came into my mind when I read these words was a work/study program where the student is studying and that's the status of student.  The work is separate from that.  It's not necessarily to advance the person's education.  It's to give the student some money.  So that's what I thought -- I thought that this was -- this was describing student status, okay; and the student is also working for some money. But you seem to say that the service -- that -- that it's -- the student status is not  independent from the service."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":2,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"No, I have in mind the typical work/study program.  The -- the student signs up for work/study and may be assigned to work in the administration, helping out with clerical things there. But the student status is one thing; the services are another. Now, that, I assume, would be covered, that the earnings of the student in the work/study program would not be subject to FICA?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Well, those five courts did it before -- most of those opinions were rendered before the new regulation."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Only one of them --"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Is it -- is it -- the -- the answer to Justice Ginsburg's question -- I was uncertain.  Suppose a student is working 45 hours a week in the grounds department cutting lawns, and he does -- cutting the school lawn, and he earns enough money to help with his way through college.  Now, I thought, under this, that he is not within this statute because it's 45 hours and not 40?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"All right."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"That it's not -- okay. So -- so, what they're doing is -- it started out with the word \"student\" and the word \"service performed\" in the statute.  Then, for many, many years, they have talked about the employment, how it has to be an incident to the study.  And \"incident\" is the key word. And so now what they've done is interpret their own word \"incident\" as saying if it bulks too large in comparison with the -- with the studying, it's  not incident to the study; it's a separate thing.  And that's true whether it happens to be medical school or it happens to be lawn mowing.  They can't -- they don't want it as so big in comparison to the study that it's not really part of trying to get the study.  It's just too big.  And they use the 40 for that."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"All right.  Now, if you're going to admit the word \"incident to,\" if you're saying they have the right to put the word \"incident to,\" why don't they have the right to define \"incident to\" in part in terms of 40 hours a week?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Mr. Olson --"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"-- everyone learns.

You see, it's not -- it's that -- I concede everything you say:  It's a total learning experience, and it's a special learning experience.  The problem I was having that I wanted your answer to is  that they have for many, many years said:  Just because it's a pure learning experience and nothing but a pure learning experience, you still can't get this exemption unless the work is incident to that experience.  And by \"incident\" we mean it can't bulk too large --"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"-- in respect to the whole.

Suppose the residents wanted to organize and collectively bargain.  If they're students, they can't do that. And let's take the Title VII and the other antidiscrimination in employment statutes.  If they're not employed, if they're students rather than employees, then they wouldn't be covered by that legislation."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"I looked it up in the dictionary, and the meaning number 1 b of \"incident\" is: an accompanying minor occurrence or -- occurrence or  condition.

Why are residents enrolled in the program? Are they enrolled in the program to make money, or are they enrolled in the program either because it's a licensing hurdle they have to clear or they want additional education, and why is the institution hiring them?  Is the institution hiring them to get the value of their services or is it hiring them for educational purposes?"},{"name":"JUSTICE ALITO","id":6,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Well, in general, though.
