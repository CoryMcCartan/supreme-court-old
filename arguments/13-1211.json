Hana Bank. Mr. Hughes. "},{"name":"JUSTICE ALITO","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"But infringement is a question for the jury, right?"},{"name":"JUSTICE ALITO","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"If it is, then why wouldn't tacking be in the same category?  Why aren't they -- Alderson Reporting Company they're similar.  In -- in infringement, you ask whether they're confusingly similar.  Tacking has a more demanding standard, but it's the same type of inquiry. So if one is for the jury, why wouldn't the other be for the jury?"},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":5,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"So -- so under your view, a district court's finding they  are reviewed in the court of appeals de novo?"},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":5,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"In this case, the key issue would be reviewed de novo."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":6,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"So isn't the key issue the commercial impression of -- and meaning how these marks were used and the commercial impression?"},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"I'm sorry.  I lost you a little bit.  Why -- why is it going to be a very Alderson Reporting Company different type of result?"},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Is the jury going to be instructed in any way on what you just told us was the reason we should view those as differently?"},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Wouldn't there be evidence or instruction on, you know, consumer impression, you have to take into account what happened between these two marks?"},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"It seems to me that it's rather critical to the contrast you draw.  I mean, what you're saying is the jury might get it right or the jury might get it wrong, and I would say, well, the Federal Circuit maybe got it right or the Federal Circuit got it wrong.  But in terms of what the factual issues are going to be, and those would include what's happening between the two marks, it seems to me the jury has got information just the way the Federal Circuit.  I don't see the difference between the two other than you think -- you think the one result is right and the other would be wrong."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":7,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Well, why doesn't the -- it seems to me the question for the jury is -- is not whether they look alike, but whether they create the same commercial impression.  And it seems to me the instructions to the jury would say these are the two marks, now what you ought to know is that after the Alderson Reporting Company first mark there was a competitor who came into commerce called American Paging, and then the mark was changed from American Mobile Phone to American Mobile Phone Paging. Do you think that that second mark creates a different commercial impression than the first one? And I think a jury would say, heck, yes."},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":5,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Well, but suppose that an important part of the case was that when American Paging came along for a few years everybody in the United States knew that. The first mark, not many people knew about it. That it seems to me would be critical to the tacking inquiry, and that the consumer's knowledge, the consumer's expertise, in knowing how consumers behave, how consumers think is -- is immensely valuable."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"And if it's viewed as a question of fact?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":6,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Are there any facts that you think a jury could determine here or should determine in this kind of a case, in a tacking case?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":6,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"How is the judge supposed to know that, what a consumer's impression would be generally?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":6,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Just to figure it out?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":6,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Some evidence would have to be presented to him or her, right?"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":8,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"I thought the Court said if we're trying to type these things, claim construction is construction of a written instrument.  That's the kind of thing --"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":8,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"-- that judges do all the Alderson Reporting Company time. But to determine whether there is -- whether the magic words, \"same continuing commercial impression to consumers,\" then the one's that's better equipped to make that determination are people who are consumers, not jurists."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":8,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"It's almost every hornbook statement of it is -- quotes that language. Even the Federal Circuit case that goes your way said that that -- that is, the question is whether the old and new mark convey the same continued commercial impression to consumers."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":8,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Well, aural or visual appearance, shouldn't that also -- aural and visual to whom? To the people likely to buy these products, not Alderson Reporting Company to the judge."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":8,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"As I understand your brief, you say, no, the test really isn't same continuing commercial impression to consumers.  You are Alderson Reporting Company saying it's the scope of -- the scope of the old and the new, and you can't use tacking to expand what the old would have meant."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":8,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"But if the answer to that is that of course you can't; if you are saying that the old one was the first use, then whatever the scope of the old one is, is it, and you can't add to it because of what you did later."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":8,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Well, why -- wait. Explain why I was wrong in saying all they have to know is what was the scope of the original mark, the one that counts?  The later change can't expand what was the original.  So that seems to answer what you say -- you seem to say, this same continuing commercial, that's not it.  It's what is the scope of the old mark and what is the scope of the new mark."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":8,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"And if the answer is that the new mark can't go beyond the scope of the old, that's the -- that's the end of that inquiry."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":8,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"But what I -- what I was trying to suggest is you would never get to what the second mark scope is because what the scope of the first one is determinative."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Again, if I could just -- what is it that you think a jury could not be instructed on in addressing that same consideration?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":7,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Do you think consistency appears in the -- in the judicial opinions that have treated this as a question of law?  I mean, what -- what is the judge -- does he get cases and look at -- look at what other cases have said is tackable and what isn't tackable?"},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Well, I guess the stare decisis point is -- is minimized, though, if you appreciate the fact that these marks are -- each one is sort of sui generis.  I mean, I don't know what precedential value I can get from looking at, you know, the dolphin changes on page 50 by the fact that there is a case about the Loctite Corporation behind.  I mean, I'm sure some are similar, but it seems to me that each one is -- is significantly different, so I don't know the significance of the stare decisis in this context."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":7,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Even -- even the ones you -- you point us to do -- do not impress me as establishing any kind of -- look on page 50, dolphin to dolphin, and the second dolphin is stylized in -- in cursive writing, right?  And that is upheld as -- as tackable.  Then on the next page, on 51, the second one from the bottom, it -- it's the opposite progression, turbo in cursive goes to turbo in -- in capital letters and that is not permitted.  I cannot for the life of me decide why the one should be permitted and the other should not be permitted."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":7,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"And I'd much rather blame it on the jury than on the court.
