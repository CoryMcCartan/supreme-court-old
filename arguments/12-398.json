Let's say it -- it treats breast cancer. A new discovery, a new way -- a way is found, previously unknown, to extract that.  You make a drug out of that.

But if that's the case, I want to know what those things are rather than you're just saying, you know, we're supposed to leave it to scientists who want Nobel Prizes.

I read your brief, but it is not a product of nature, it's a product of human invention."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":10,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"I know, but I don't see the answer because I gather, if I -- if I've read it correctly, that when you have an R -- the messenger RNA does not have the same base pairs.

So -- so you would discover something with an A there, you see, and you wouldn't discover something with a U there.  And there is no such thing in nature as the no-introns AGG, whatever, okay?  It's not there.  That's not truly isolated DNA.  But you can go look up the Amazon, wherever you want.  Hence the question.  Now, on that one, how?  How is that found in nature?  The answer is it isn't."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":5,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"But that goes to obviousness.

When you are on that, that's good.  A more basic question to me is  when you use the word \"dangerous.\"  I had thought -- and you can -- I'd be interested in your view -- that the patent law is filled with uneasy compromises because on the one hand, we do want people to invent.  On the other hand, we're very worried about them tying up some kind of whatever it is, particularly a thing that itself could be used for further advance. And so that the compromise that has been built historically into this area is, of course, if you get a new satisfying process to extract the sap from the plant in the Amazon, patented.  Of course, if you get the sap out and you find that you can use it, you manipulate it, you use it, you figure out a way to use it to treat cancer, wonderful, patented.  But what you can't patent is the sap itself. Now, in any individual case that might be unfortunate or fortunate.  But consider it in the mine run of things.  It's important to keep products of nature free of the restrictions that patents there are, so when Captain Ferno goes to the Amazon and discovers 50 new types of plants, saps and medicines, discovers them, although that expedition was expensive, although nobody had found it before, he can't get a patent on the thing itself.  He gets a patent on the process, on the use of the thing, but not the thing itself.  Now, that's my understanding of what I'd call hornbook patent law, which you I confess probably understand better than I."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":10,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"And I would like you to express your view on that because that's the framework that I am bringing to the case."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":4,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Even though -- even though the government has disavowed it, even though the government, representing the United States --"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":4,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"At least that the  strength of the presumption would be diluted."},{"name":"JUSTICE KAGAN","id":9,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Mr. Castanias, could I take you away from the deference point and just ask again about the -- the kind of law that you would have us make.
