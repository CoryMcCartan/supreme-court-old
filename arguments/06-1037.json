Now I'd like to hear what the reason is that justifies that difference. You give him six extra years when he retired after 14 years and though he was only 49 years old, and you don't give him even one extra year when everything else was the same but he retired after he was 55.

If you let him retire, and you gave him 14 years of credit, you would be treating him just like you're treating me. But in addition to letting him retire, you give him six extra years of credit, which at two and-a-half percent per year. Good, I'm glad you do that.

What's your response?"},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"This has been very helpful, but it does seem to me to raise a question about the fairness of your opening statement. You began by saying something to the effect that this does not discriminate on the basis of age. It does. Age is the explicit factor that the statute uses in order to answer Justice Breyer's question. And the Act does not prohibit the use of age in all circumstances to which it applies, but it does -- the Act goes on to prohibit the use of age in some of the circumstances. And one of those circumstances is the hypothetical of the 55-plus-year-old person used in Justice Breyer's statement and example. So, it is not correct, it seems to me, for you to say that this does not discriminate on the basis of age. Now, maybe there is some good reasons for doing that, you can get into that, but it seems to me it does make an explicit determination based on age as to some people."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":5,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"You're saying you're one step removed.

And because the odds are that we'll say the person in the 55-year-old category has worked less and endured less risk, it is, therefore, fair to impute less time on average to such a person, and therefore, give a lower benefit. You're saying there is a tradeoff. And the tradeoff is because the 55-year-old retiree may get a benefit after very little work and very little risk, it is therefore fair and not a discrimination that on the average the windfall is less for that person by the imputation than the windfall to the person who retires on the basis of age 20.

But the Age Discrimination Act doesn't apply to younger workers.

The disability pay when you no longer can be in the hazardous occupation, it will begin immediately, right?

What you do when the person is disabled and he is not yet 55 -- he hasn't qualified yet -- is you both qualify him, and when you qualify him you give him credit for years he hasn't worked. Now, the older person who is still working and is also disabled says: Fine, you let me retire, but you don't give me any extra years. Now that's the complaint, I think. So that if you had a person who had started at 45, eligible to retire at 55, works for 4 years and becomes disabled, he is credited with 14 years; while the person who started at 35 and at 45 becomes disabled, he is given 20 years. He is given the 10 extra years. So the first person, older person, says: You gave him some extra years; you didn't have to give him those extra years in order to qualify him to retire. You could have just said you can retire, but you gave him 10 extra years and you give me no extra years. Why not?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"You don't need anything to bring you to normal retirement. You could rewrite the plan and say when a person becomes disabled you get retirement, right at that moment. You could say that. And what the plaintiff is saying is, why don't you say that? Though it's a bit mean. But I think what he would probably like is you would extend the extra years to him."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"So the effect of this litigation is that policemen or firefighters who are injured and become disabled now get lower benefits for disability?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"See, that's why I think the result in this case is just terrible.

I mean, the exception in the statute is for -- for retirement, taking age into account for retirement, is narrowly crafted. It says that they can make any decision about -- they can require the attainment of a minimum age as a condition of eligibility for normal or early retirement. Now, we have not read that to exclude adding an additional element to age, namely age plus years of service. We don't say that that disables you from the -- from that exemption. Why can't you add a third factor? Age, years of service, and disability."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":5,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"And - -"},{"name":"JUSTICE ALITO","id":8,"spokeBefore":5,"sideBefore":"justices","text":"It seems to me that what Kentucky is trying to do is to, at least in part, provide make-whole benefits for a police officer who becomes disabled below the age of 55. So what they want to do is to say we want to give you the benefit that you would have received if you had not been hurt on the job and therefore unable to work and had been able to work to the normal retirement age. Now, if that's correct, is that an illegitimate objective? And if it's not an illegitimate objective, is there any way that they can do that consistent with your understanding of the ADEA? Because when someone is over the retirement age, it's rather hard to see how many years you would add on projecting how long that person would continue to work beyond the age of retirement eligibility."},{"name":"JUSTICE ALITO","id":8,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"So if they want to do that and they have a case of a police officer who works beyond 55 -- the officer is 55-plus with 10 years of service and then becomes disabled -- you say they have to give that person 10 years of credit."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":7,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"But he is saying one thing more. He is saying it's also highly unlikely that the 55-year-old has worked as long subject to risk at the point at which the calculation is made than is the case with the person who retires on the basis of 20 years.

And this would seem to be a number 1 exhibit."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":3,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"No, because what you are looking at is to see whether the purpose of Congress is somehow implicated, a purpose designed to prevent stereotypical thinking from being used to put older people at a disadvantage.

She is going to get a very low disability. And you say that's one thing that's all right. On a prospective basis, what could Kentucky do? One is give the younger workers only their actual years of service, which Mr. Klausner said is what is happening, and therefore, these people are getting a lot less than they used to get. And then you say, oh, but there's another way, and that is to impute additional years of service on an age-neutral basis.

And it results -- if we adopt your system where you can look only at years of service, what it, in effect, is going to do is to prevent Kentucky from giving disability benefits to older workers who become disabled. For example, if you have two workers, one who starts work at 18 and acquires years of service, say, 12 years of service and becomes disabled, you would say, well, you can take those years of service into account. The older worker who begins at age 30 and is disabled in his first year on the job, you say, well, you can only look at years of service. You can't impute to both of them retirement age.

He is only 35; and, moreover, at 55 when you retire in our police force, we give you a big party and a gold watch. Well, we don't do that if you retire later on. Same kind of claim. Why not?
