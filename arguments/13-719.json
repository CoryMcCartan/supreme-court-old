So the question is you're arguing, yes, there was something unlawful.  The unusual thing about the case is the person who tells us what they were doing is the dissent. Now, I don't know why the dissent says that was a reason -- as I read the dissent.  Maybe other people read it differently, but as I read the dissent, the dissenter was telling us that that was a significant factor in their decision.  All right.

A district court has to make a decision on something as to which the district court has discretion. A party urges the district court to make a particular Alderson Reporting Company decision based on one ground.  And the one ground is based on a legal error.  The district court rules in favor of that party but says absolutely nothing.  Now the issue is raised on appeal, the argument is that the trial judge abused his or her discretion. Now, would that be insulate it from review for abuse of discretion on the ground that, well, we really don't know why the judge did what the judge did? The judge didn't say anything.  So the judge might not have based the decision on this one -- on this legal error, the only ground that was urged upon the court.

And if that's all that appeals courts were doing when they decide whether to take an appeal, then you would be right.  But, in fact, we know from Alderson Reporting Company everything we do every day that when a court decides to take something or not to take something, they are not just making a merits evaluation.  They are doing a thousand other things as well about how they think it's best to arrange their docket.  And what we don't know is whether the Tenth Circuit here did one of those things."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Well, I guess it's an abuse of discretion whenever we fail to correct a clear error of law on a petition for certiorari.

I thought we just had the Alderson Reporting Company power to say we don't feel like taking it."},{"name":"JUSTICE KAGAN","id":5,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"But this statute gives the appellate courts tremendous discretion on this area.  It says it may take an appeal, it may not take an appeal. Think of the thousand things that you want to think about, not anything invidious, not anything permissible, but, you know, whether to take an appeal.  And that's the only thing we know about it. Here's a question for you, because I sympathize with you.  Because the next half-hour is going to reveal that, actually, most of us agree with you on the merits.

I will limit it, I agree with you on the merits.  All right?  But I just don't see how to get around this.  Here's my suggestion. Would it be sufficient for your purposes, you're worried about the sort of continuing effect of this, to just sort of get rid of this case, dismiss this Alderson Reporting Company case, but to -- we often explain why we dismiss cases and to suggest that we are dismissing it because we don't know whether the Tenth Circuit made a decision on the merits.  And if and to the extent that the Tenth Circuit wants in the next case to make a decision on the merits, and if and to the extent that the Tenth Circuit wants in the next case to make a decision on the merits when it denies an appeal, it should say so, so as not to insulate that decision from review. That seems like a fair thing to say to the Tenth Circuit.  Don't insulate your merits decisions from review.

The statute gives the court of appeals the discretion to decide whether there will be an appeal or not.  And you're saying, oh, no, if they decide there won't be you -- you just reach in, and you have cert before judgment.  I think that's a real frustration of the purpose of this statute, which says these matters, you know, are not all that significant.  So it doesn't come to federal court.  It stays in state court, who cares?  We trust our state courts. I mean, the whole purpose of the statute is to make this, you know, a quick and dirty judgment. That's why they don't have to state reasons.  They just say no appeal, or appeal. And you're saying, oh, no.        It suddenly becomes laden with -- with all sorts of requirements that if they're not observed, we -- we grant cert before judgment.

They can do that forever without any review by this Court?"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":8,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"But it was just pointed out that lawyers in the Tenth Circuit are not going to take that risk.  The Tenth Circuit precedent, which the Alderson Reporting Company district court followed, says you must produce in the notice of appeal evidence. So what lawyer is going to say to his client, now, we can easily do that, but I won't because I want to test whether the Tenth Circuit precedent is wrong. As a practical matter, this will be unreviewable because the lawyers will simply conform to what the Tenth Circuit says is the law."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":8,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Maybe -- maybe because it thought there wouldn't be any controversy.

That is, I thought that they -- they were going -- the relevant statute is 1453(c)(1), which says a court of appeals may accept an appeal, notwithstanding Section 1447(d), from an order of the district court granting or denying a motion to remand.  All right? So we are not talking about 1447(d); we are talking about 1453(c)(1). Now, what they did is they said they have an order, and the order says, no, we won't accept it.  And the question is, is that order reviewed in this Court? I didn't think there was disagreement that it is reviewable. If they had said, We will not accept it because if we think that it only applies to stoppage in transitu cases, they would have their reason.

You know, you say (c)(2), which is the preponderance standard, but that's just a standard that the court is going to use to make the determination about whether to be in Federal court or not. But it seems to me that the statute is best read -- is really only read to comport as Justice Ginsburg said, with the rest of the Federal rules.  It's notice pleading, then the original plaintiff has a choice.  The original plaintiff can contest the -- the removal and present evidence and in that case, the defendant comes back with evidence and the defendant bears the burden of proof and the court makes its decision on the basis of that two sets of evidence.

Most class action plaintiffs are not going to contest that their claim is worth at least $500,000."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":8,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Well, I don't follow that because ordinarily a plaintiff would state what the plaintiff's damages are."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":8,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"In -- in the -- let's take a case in the Federal court, a class action case.

I just -- you said if it doesn't come in at the time of removal, it Alderson Reporting Company comes in at the time of remand.  But there's an alternate position, which is the notice of removal is just the allegation, if the plaintiff wants to contest that, the plaintiff can contest that, and then the defendant has to come forward with something because the defendant has the burden of proof. Likewise, if the court thinks that the allegation is not appropriate, the court can sua sponte say, you know, you have to show me more because I'm not sure I have jurisdiction over this. But either way, it all happens in the Federal court after the notice of removal, which is merely an allegation, is filed.  And that makes perfect sense.

Now, when in fact a party appeals a district court's remand, he files that appeal paper in the court of appeals.  The case is there.  Before they decide it, we could take it.  After they decide it, and if they affirm it, or if they decide to hear it, we could take it.  It's there. But suppose they say no.        Does that remove it from the court of appeals?  If the answer to that question, which is your position that you're arguing, is now this Court can't take it, then it can't take anything.  It can't take the same things down in the -- in the habeas cases.  It can't take the attorney's fees things.  It can't take anything, I would guess because it would say where a court has discretion and says, no, we are not taking it, it's not reviewable in this Court because it's no longer in the court of appeals.
