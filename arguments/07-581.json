And that seems to lend some substance to the -- to the point made by the other side that if we accept your position here, we are accepting a position not nearly as far -- that the designation -- a procedural designation of a forum should be enforced but that, in fact, total control over the assertion of a statutory Federal right is also being ceded.

But my understanding is that suppose you are -- you are an employee. You believe your employer discriminated against you, say, on gender grounds. You have to go to the EEOC. Now, the EEOC looks into it and very often what they do is they don't really resolve it. They just give you a letter that gives you a right to sue. So here Congress was so worried about this kind of thing that they said our specialized agency, you know, won't be the bottom line. People will go there and then they have a right to sue later. Now, that's how Congress felt about this particular statute. Why would they want the union to be the bottom line when, in fact, the employee himself hasn't agreed? I mean, the employee might agree in the first place. He might say I'm going to take that letter, I'm not going to bring my suit. That's up to him or her. But here the employee wants to bring her suit, just like the EEOC letter."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":9,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Exactly. That's my point, is that the statute as a whole reflects a considerable effort not to let this employee get cut off at the pass and an employee who is reasonably determined to get to court probably can do it. It's not definite. The EEOC doesn't have to give them a letter giving them a right to sue, but probably can do it. And if that's a situation where you have this whole expert thing cut in, it seems to me there is a parallel here that Congress then wouldn't want the union and the employer together to be able to cut that right to sue off, at least not very easily."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":5,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"But the union could not bargain about these anti-discrimination rights.

So I thought it was the -- ultimately the implication of your argument that in any -- in any case in which arbitration is claimed, there would have to be -- or a right to go to arbitration is claimed by the employer - - there would have to be, not merely the collective bargaining agreement, but a specific waiver by the employee to -- to go ahead and do that.

And sometimes unions also would rather have the more effective machine or sometimes unions feel their workers are stupid not to read the machine label properly or -- I mean, I can replicate anything you might think. We can think of tort suits, the two of us, which could put unions and employees on opposite shores, just as we can think of discrimination suits. Most unions don't want discrimination. I mean, most of the time. And most unions don't want dangerous machines most of the time.

And what I'm wondering here is if you win here, what is the set of such claims that I have now said that a union, through a collective bargaining contract, can force the employee against his will to go to arbitration over?

Could they be subjected to mandatory arbitration?"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":5,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"What about - -"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":5,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"-- if it's not a statutory right; it's just a wrongful discharge? One practical problem is so often these are overlapping claims. You can say, \"I was discriminated against before because of my age. I was arbitrarily discriminated against. It was a wrongful discharge. It was a discharge without just cause.\" Usually, there's multiple claims that can be made, and some of them would be bargainable, I mean, would come under the union -- I mean if it was just a question of the worker says, \"I was discharged without just cause,\" no Title 7 or anything else, that would come under the arbitration clause, wouldn't it?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":7,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Why has it? Why has it? I mean, let's assume that my gripe with my employer is that he hasn't paid me my salary for the last two months. Now, you can't take away my right to that unless I voluntarily waived it. What is sacrosanct about the fact that my grievance here has some discrimination attached to it? Your briefing talks as though it is something totally apart from a mere economic right. Ninety-nine percent of the time, you're talking about economics. \"I was fired because of discrimination.\" \"I wasn't promoted because of discrimination and therefore I lost this -- this amount of money or that amount of money.\" Why is it unthinkable that the -- that the employee would have to go through the union-prescribed arbitration for the fact that he wasn't paid for the last three months but does not have to do it for an economic injury that occurs because of discrimination?"},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Well, isn't that kind of conflict always present whenever you have collective action?

That happens in every situation where you have collective action."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Well, they don't have to be vindicated in particular ways.

They may say: Look, we don't like to arbitrate. In fact, the arbitration is of great benefit to workers, but it is very expensive to bring these claims, even with the prospect of recovering fees.

I -- I -- the -- the issue in front of us, as I see it, is just what you said: When can a union require the worker to accept arbitration rather than a court case in an instance where the union member has not signed a special waiver? That's the question, right? Okay. And what I think some of us were struggling for here is: If we say yes to you they can force them, or no to you they can't, what's the principle? Now, the easiest kind of case where you tend to think they can force the worker into arbitration is where the right grows out of the collective bargaining agreement, period. Then we have what we were talking about with Justice Souter, a common law tort claim. Then we might have a State law giving a claim. Then we might have a Federal law like this one giving a claim. And we just heard -- I would assume if Justice Scalia thought of such a case, then the response was, which was the FSLA: Oh, well, maybe we can't, you know, force the worker to give that one up either.

If it's within the subject of mandatory bargaining but it's not effective unless the employee also signs at the time of the incident or at the time he is hired an individual waiver, then, in fact, the only case in which it's going to make any difference as to whether you win or he wins is the case in which the agreement has got a clause in there that gives the union plenary authority to dispose of the claim.
