So, the sweet is an acquittal-first system, where you force a jury to reach agreement on one thing before it goes to the next thing, makes compromised jury verdicts harder, and that's why a State might say we want an acquittal-first system. The bitter that most States take with that is that they say, well, if we're forcing them to agree on these things and they agree on a verdict of not guilty, we're stuck with that. Now, what Arkansas seems to want is a system in which it forces juries to agree on the -- the greater charges before going to the less, but won't take the consequence of that, which is that sometimes they agree that on the greater charges, they're not guilty.MR. MCDANIEL:  No, Justice Kagan.  The -- the majority of the States and circuits recognize there is a difference between a hard-transition instruction and an acquittal-first instruction.  They recognize the difference between a partial verdict and a general verdict on charges that include lesser and includeds. And what we require is one verdict on a charge:  guilty or not guilty. And they are at liberty to consider -- they can be at the very end -- again, it's very important to know -- it's wholly speculative in this case to know where they were when they ultimately were hung.  And so, we are -- we are operating in the world of bright-line rules, which are very important for jeopardy. We know when jeopardy attaches.  When the jury is in the box.
