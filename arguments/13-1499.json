And the letter could either say, \"and we'll let the judge know if you gave a contribution\" and -- or the candidate know, and she can write you a thank-you note, she will write you a thank-you note if you contributed.  Or, you speak for the Florida bar, so you said it would be okay to put that in the letter, but if that's not, at least you could put in the letter and under  Florida law the candidate can see the list of people who contributed.
