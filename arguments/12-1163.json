Allcare Health Management Systems. Mr. Katyal. "},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"How -- how does abuse of discretion work with respect to a pure legal question?"},{"name":"JUSTICE KAGAN","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Well, would you explain that to me a little bit, Mr. Katyal.  In a case in which the district court just uses an erroneous claim construction, you would concede that that's a pure legal question, so that would be an abuse of discretion?"},{"name":"JUSTICE KAGAN","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"No, but I -- I guess my first question was just if what -- if the district court says, Here's the appropriate claim construction, and in saying that, it's wrong."},{"name":"JUSTICE KAGAN","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Is that a legal question?"},{"name":"JUSTICE KAGAN","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Okay.  So let's just assume for a moment that an erroneous claim construction would be a mistake of law.  Let's just assume that.  And I understand you say that there's a question. But if that's right, why is it not also true that a judge's statement that a litigant -- that a litigant's claim construction was unreasonable is not a similar mistake of law?"},{"name":"JUSTICE KAGAN","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"But isn't the main thing the judge doing when it says that a claim construction is unreasonable is essentially measuring the delta between the actual -- the correct claim construction and the mistaken claim construction?  And doesn't that seem to be, again, assuming that the claim construction itself is a question of law?  Doesn't that itself seem to be a question of law?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":5,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"If we undo --"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":6,"spokeBefore":5,"sideBefore":"justices","text":"On your reading, Mr. Katyal, I take it that if the district court denies fees, there would be slim to no chance of getting that overturned on appeal if you're dealing with the abuse of -- abuse of discretion."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":6,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"But if you leave it to the district court that way and the district court denies fees, isn't there a -- a risk of large disparities from district judge to district judge.  One will say, yes, I think that this was uncommon, not run of the mine, so I'm going to award fees, and another one of them will say, no, I think it's pretty standard, so I won't award fees."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":5,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Mr. Katyal, if we were to overrule the Brooks Furniture standard -- you've just heard the argument where that issue is being presented to us in Octane.  If we were to do that, how would that affect this case?  Wouldn't it essentially moot the question because you wouldn't have this objective reasonableness test controlling the outcome?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":5,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"So when does that become a pure question of law?"},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Fletcher. "},{"name":"JUSTICE ALITO","id":7,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Well, you can make -- you can make that argument with respect to every legal issue that's raised on appeal.  Well, if you have to decide whether the lower court was right, that's a lot of work. But if all you have to decide is whether the lower court abused its discretion in deciding if the law means what the lower court said it means, that's a lot less work."},{"name":"JUSTICE ALITO","id":7,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"So that argument is a strange argument, unless there's something really special about the attorneys' fees context.  And I guess that's your argument, there's something really special. But why should it?        I mean, you've got a lot of money involved.  Why should we say, this is collateral litigation, even though it involves millions of dollars more than the claim in many other types of cases?"},{"name":"JUSTICE ALITO","id":7,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"It can clarify what the law is.  What's the difference between that situation and, let's say, deciding an issue of qualified immunity in a civil rights case or applying the -- applying AEDPA in a habeas case?  The court can say this is what the law is, and then after that, as the second step, determine whether a particular interpretation of the law was reasonable.  You could do the same thing here."},{"name":"JUSTICE ALITO","id":7,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Well, I'm just wondering, if you put together your two arguments about what the standard should be and what the standard of review should be, whether there really is going to be any meaningful review of what district courts do in this situation. Maybe you could just describe for me what an appellate decision would look like, saying that applying the totality of the circumstances, the district court abused its discretion in awarding or not awarding fees. What would an appellate court say."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Dunner. "},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":5,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Even if I assumed that ultimately the claim that you made might have been -- might have had a basis, like the court below agreed, as I read the district court's decision, it wasn't basing its decision merely on that.  What it was basing it on, Alderson Reporting Company and it goes through a whole laundry list of things that it thought constituted abusive litigation -- very little prefiling investigation, continuous switch of claims because of the lack of that investigation, pursuing a theory that your expert didn't even agree with -- that all sounds to me like a factual basis, basically saying this litigation was abusive. And I don't understand how that doesn't feed into the objective unreasonableness, meaning that if you had done the investigation you should have, you may have had a claim or thought you had a claim, but you would have learned much earlier that even your expert disputed things and you're likely not to have brought the suit. That's how I read the district court's decision."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Well, but then it reads four to three on one issue, then it has, as in this case, conflicting cases within its own docket.  So Alderson Reporting Company I'm not sure it's succeeding in bringing about uniformity."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Well, I'm just saying, the point -- you're quite correct, the Federal Circuit was established to bring about uniformity in patent law, but they seem to have a great deal of disagreement among themselves and are going back and forth in particular cases, in this area specifically, about what the appropriate approach is."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":8,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Well, they do sometimes.  I mean --"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":8,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"There are a lot of areas of the law where they do.  I mean, Holmes thought reasonableness, given undisputed facts, is really a question of law.  Probable cause matters are really questions of law, if the facts are undisputed.  Cases all over the law, there was a case we had -- I had, I saw once, it said, is an Eclectus Parrot a wild bird for purposes of a statute that says wild birds cannot be imported, and the judges there said, Well, is this characteristic factual?  Da, da, da.  And is this characteristic really -- if you really put your mind to it, you'd have to say that was legal; does \"wild\" mean in the country of origin or in the country of import? You know, so you could separate it.        But there are many, many areas of the law where judges don't bother to separate the two things.  And isn't claim construction like that?  I mean, you have a case and the claim constructionist always has in mind what this infringing item might be in respect to the claim, and so the judge is always looking at that and doesn't often separate law and fact.  I mean, am I -- you know this area better than I do. Alderson Reporting Company"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":8,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Oh, I guarantee. (Laughter.)"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":8,"spokeBefore":8,"sideBefore":"justices","text":"So I'm thinking that maybe claim construction is like that very often.  Factual matters are there, legal matters are there, and judges cannot always separate the one from the other, or even if they could, they don't feel it's worth the effort."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Well, what about Judge Moore's point that when you're talking about pure issues of patent law maybe you're right, but when you're talking about baselessness, that's something that the district courts actually have more experience with, whether it's under EAJA, whether it's under AEDPA, whether it's under qualified immunity.  That's an issue they see all the time, so maybe they are more expert than the Federal Circuit."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Well, you've got to stop charging such outrageous fees. (Laughter.)"},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Oh, no."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":6,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Two of the items that you mentioned, one was venue, and the other was claim preclusion, issue preclusion, the Federal Circuit is no more expert in those areas than a district court would be."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":6,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"venue question."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":6,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"The -- you mentioned the And I was surprised.  The Court said, well, that's for the Pennsylvania court to sanction."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":6,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"But you, I'm sure, have read Noxell case in the D.C. Circuit --"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":6,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"-- one of the problems there, one of the conduct that was considered unreasonable was suing in -- in a distant forum, very far from where the defendants operated. And claim preclusion and issue preclusion come up in all kinds of cases, so there's nothing expert about the Federal Circuit on those issues."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":9,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Well, you know, once you -- once you have a statute that confers discretion on a district court, you don't expect uniformity of decision-making.  It gives the district judge a broad -- broad discretion, and some will come out at the top and Alderson Reporting Company some will come out at the bottom.  And they will all be -- be affirmed by the court of appeals. So what makes you think that -- that this statute, which clearly confers discretion, envisions uniformity --"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":9,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"-- on the part of the district courts?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":9,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"It seems to me it quite clearly doesn't."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":9,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Well -- well, you -- you acknowledged that a lot of these cases -- probably most of these cases do not involve exclusively legal issues. Right?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":9,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"And so in -- in all of those cases you're not going to get uniformity, because their -- you acknowledge that in -- in the nonlegal issues, there is discretion in the district court.  So you're going to have some district courts coming out some ways, other district courts coming out the other way, and they will all be affirmed. So the -- it seems to me -- this does not strike me as an area where Congress expected uniformity."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":9,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"You're -- you're creating uniformity in one narrow aspect of -- of this decision, that involving legal claims, but there are many other aspects of the decisions that will destroy whatever uniformity you're trying to achieve."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":8,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"The problem with -- the problem is -- the one I think that -- that really seems to me at the heart of what you have to decide, is it worth saying to the court of appeals start distinguishing between which of the two categories it falls into.  Because the statement that you read, most Alderson Reporting Company lawyers would agree with that statement as a general principle. And then the question becomes, well, it's work to decide whether this is purely legal or whether it's legal/factual mixed and sometimes it's one and sometimes the other and they are really no key to it exactly. So what you're doing is saying, in an area where there are a lot of the deferential kind and some of the nondeferential kind, we want to say the Federal Circuit and all the district courts have to stop and figure that thing out, while the other side says, look, just leave it to the district court and tell them to review. Theirs is simpler.        What do you say?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":5,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"I'm sorry.  I'm -- I'm a Alderson Reporting Company little confused.  With respect to winning or losing the case, you're going to get de novo review because the Federal Circuit here looked at the claim construction, under de novo review agreed with the district court that it had construed the claim properly and that you lost. So you got de novo review. The issue on a reasonable ground to pursue the litigation, whether it was objectively reasonable or not, I think that's Justice Breyer's point, which it generally has factors that are independent of winning or losing, and that's why I kept going back to what the district court said in this case, which you seem to ignore.  It, at one point, recognizes that your claim was a difficult one, but it says that doesn't excuse the fact that you maintained the 52(c) claim, the one at issue here, even after both the master -- special master and your expert had said a particular claim wasn't sustainable.  And it continued with a long example of behavior -- examples, multiple ones, that it found unreasonable, having nothing to do with the ultimate reasonableness of your last argument before the appellate court. So, again I ask the question:        Why should this objective reasonableness be considered a pure question of law?  Because it's not about right or wrong Alderson Reporting Company and legal answer; it's about behavior during litigation."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Thank you, counsel.
