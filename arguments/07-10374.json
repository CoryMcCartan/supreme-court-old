In other areas, even if they call it jurisdictional, it really doesn't seem that way, such as, well, you've got to give this much notice or you've got to -- you know, maybe those things aren't really jurisdictional.

That is, you can sue a correctional official for declaratory relief, you could sue for injunctive relief. All New York has taken away is one mode of relief. That's not jurisdictional unless you say that every element of damages is jurisdictional. New York allows this type of claim in their courts. We are talking about jurisdiction over the person?

The neutral reason is the State sees there are just too many cases in which prisoners are suing correctional officials. So then they say: Here's what we are going to do about it. First, under State law, we will wipe out all the suits and give them instead an action against the State. But we know there are still some Federal cases about the same thing. So what we are going to do is we are going to say bring them in Federal court. Why bring them in State court? So now we've dealt with our administrative problem. So that's their neutral administrative reason. Now, people would like to bring 1983 actions still in State or Federal court. It may be more convenient. They get attorneys' fees, and the attorneys' fees you don't get under the State law.
