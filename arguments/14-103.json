And you can't say all of them are for the benefit of the estate.  And there are loads of things they do to help administer the estate and hire all kinds of people.  And -- and paying their fees is part of the administration, I would think, normally. Why don't you see the paying of the lawyer as part of the administration of the estate?  And if you see the part -- that part as part of the administration of the estate, then you'd see that the administrative expenses necessary to secure that payment are part of the administration.

And so now a different risk is eventuated -- namely, you had to go to litigation -- and that wasn't in the 100,000.  Well, then, if it's reasonable and everything, why shouldn't it be? I mean, why is -- you're -- you're trying to, in that 100,000, give the employer something for their -- for their time and their effort and also Alderson Reporting Company compensate certain risks.  And here was one that wasn't in the  100,000.  It turned up later.  But how would you draw a line between some and the other?

Well, you know, there are risks in this; and one of the risks is they're going to have to go to court Alderson Reporting Company and somebody will sue them and they have to go litigate that.

Yes."},{"name":"JUSTICE KAGAN","id":10,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Yeah.  So some of the things that we've said are permissible for enhancements are exceptional delays in payment, extraordinary outlays of expenses, and unusually protracted litigation -- okay? -- that those count as enhancements.  We said that in Alderson Reporting Company Perdue v. Kenny A.  Why isn't this just like that?"},{"name":"JUSTICE KAGAN","id":10,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"No, no, no.  But I'm proceeding on the assumption of -- on the SG's assumption that what we're trying to do is to get a reasonable rate for the services that clearly have been authorized.  And the question is:  What's a reasonable rate? And it seems to me that what this statute does is to say \"reasonable\" can include, like, lots of things.  It's highly discretionary.  Right? And then on top of that, you know, it -- included in \"what is reasonable\" is this idea of sometimes you can do performance enhancements, but we haven't said performance enhancements are just for super-duper work.  We've actually said performance enhancements are for things like unusually protracted Alderson Reporting Company litigation and lots of expenses and exceptional delays, sort of like this. You know, this is just an expense of your work, is having to go after the fees.  So why doesn't that get into the mix, too?"},{"name":"JUSTICE KAGAN","id":10,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"No, it does, because the text just says \"reasonable.\"  And then the question is what's reasonable?  And \"reasonable\" can include, you know, you're getting the same hourly rate as some other lawyer, but \"reasonable\" is, also, you had to do this over a very extended period of time and \"reasonable\" is, also, boy, you had to spend a lot of money in order to get them to pay you anything at all.  All of those things count as what's part of \"reasonable.\""},{"name":"JUSTICE KAGAN","id":10,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Yeah, it's reasonable for all the other work you're doing.  But then everything else goes into this question of reasonable, right? Is -- you know, I'll give you a hypothetical. Suppose I hire somebody to shovel my driveway, and I say, I'm going to give you reasonable compensation.  And everybody knows that it's $10 an hour to hire my driveway, right?  That's the going rate. But then I say, oh, did I not tell you -- did I not tell you I'm going to make you go down -- come down to the court so that I can pay you the $10?  And that costs another $5.  All right? Now, it strikes me that if somebody said, what's reasonable compensation now, it would be $15.  It wouldn't be $10.  And it's the exact same thing here. It's like by the time you go through all this stuff that you have to go through to get paid, you should get paid more."},{"name":"JUSTICE KAGAN","id":10,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"But it doesn't say you can't get paid for it.  There's no exclusion.  All, you know -- you know, I think you and the SG agree, it's -- we're not counting this as the service.  What we're saying is you have to be reasonably paid for the obvious services that you have performed, shoveling my driveway. And in my -- in my hypothetical, that means you also have to be paid for the cab fare.  And similarly, here, it means you also have to be paid for the cost of, like, making them sign a check to you."},{"name":"JUSTICE KAGAN","id":10,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Well, it doesn't have to go be- -- I mean, I just don't understand what that means. Alderson Reporting Company It's this -- it's the clear service rendered, it's shoveling my driveway, it's doing the work for the estate.  What counts as reasonable?  What counts as reasonable is not just the hourly rate, but all the things I've put you through to get the hourly rate."},{"name":"JUSTICE KAGAN","id":10,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"But here's the problem, I think, with that response.  It's a reasonable response, but we're already out of the American rule here.  I mean, the bankruptcy system puts you in a different universe than a statutory universe, and the question is what do those words of the statute say?  It's not what would exist if the statute didn't exist."},{"name":"JUSTICE KAGAN","id":10,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Well, the American rule can't trump the statute.  The statute has to trump the American rule.  And if the statute says reasonable compensation for services rendered -- the obvious services rendered, and -- and the only thing that counts as reasonable is taking into account things like how protracted the litigation is and how much risk you've had and the exceptional delay, and the fact that you've had to contest a lot, a lot, a lot of meritless objections, all of those things make for something -- go into the question of what's reasonable.  They don't have to.  I mean, in 90 percent of the cases, it might be that it's like, no, that's just a normal part of the process.  But in that other 10 percent, where it's not a normal part of the process and you wouldn't be reasonably paid unless they were included, it seems to me the word reasonable demands that they be included."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":4,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"What about other statutes?
