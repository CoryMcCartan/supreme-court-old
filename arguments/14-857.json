They went to court seeking an injunction. The court said, no, no. You have a contract. You have to file again. You have to go into a different court. You have to start all over again.

He asked for attorneys' fees, but he's not entitled to attorneys' fees. And he asked for an injunction or declaratory relief, and he's not entitled to that. And he asked for class certification, but he's not entitled to that, and so the case is moot. And the \"so the case is moot\" seems to me to be a non sequitur. In other words, he's asked for these things, you haven't offered these things, and there's a dispute about whether he's entitled to these things. Now, you might be completely right as to that, \"He's not entitled to attorneys' fees.\" But that has to be adjudicated. You can't --  a court can't just Alderson Reporting Company say, oh, you've offered complete relief, because in his view you haven't offered complete relief, and that's what the litigation is all about."},{"name":"JUSTICE KAGAN","id":5,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"A court can absolutely make that determination.
