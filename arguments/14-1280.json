Would that be a fair statement?"},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Because -- look, do we -- it sounds to me from the way you began your argument that we take this case on the assumption that, if he had picked up the sign, that if he had been supporting the candidate for chief of police who was challenging the incumbent, if he had been engaged in the activity, that would be protected. He could not have been demoted. If -- you want us to take the case on that -- do we have to accept that proposition for you to prevail in this case?"},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Well, but the -- the First Amendment talks about abridging freedom of speech, and I thought the case came to us on the proposition that he wasn't engaging in speech at all. That he was not engaging in association, he was not engaging in trying to convey a message, he was just picking up a sign for his mother.

I mean, he was fired for the wrong reason, but there's no constitutional right not to be fired for the wrong reason. If he was fired because his -- his -- his -- his government employer thought he had committed a felony and he hadn't, he might -- he might have a cause of action under some statute.

I was off, you know, in a different town then. In other words, it's a pure mistake of fact. Your answers, it seems to me, you try to get Alderson Reporting Company advantage of the fact that there -- you could perhaps have argued this was expressive activity. Say, oh, he was at a meeting, a political event. He was getting a sign.

Up to now, those lawsuits would have to show I was asserting a First Amendment right, and it's for that reason that I was not promoted. But what you're saying is, you don't have to show that at all. All you have to assert is that the reason I was not promoted was that the -- the employer believed that I was thus and so or not thus and so.
