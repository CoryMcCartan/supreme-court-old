The premise of my question is this. We -- we generally regard mitigation evidence as favoring life, aggravation evidence as favoring death. We've got a case in which the -- the assumption is that they are evenly balanced. The -- the pans of the scale are exactly even on that. Kansas says in that case the jury shall return the verdict of death. If we are going to demand, as we have said that we're going to demand, that the determination -- that the death penalty determination be one of what we have called reasoned moral judgment, then what has to be supplied in order to make the Kansas provision consistent with reasoned moral justice, it seems to me, is a presumption in favor of death. Other things being equal, there is a presumption in favor of death. And my question is, am I correct in saying that in order to hold your way, we have to hold that the eighth amendment -- is consistent with the eighth amendment to presume the appropriateness of death, other things being equal?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"You -- you agree that's -- 1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 that's a proper way to look at the issue then."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Then how do you get off the dime?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Yes, but the -- the direction, as I understand it, is that if mitigation and aggravation are even, then the only way to come to a conclusion is to say, as the statute does, because the mitigation does not outweigh the aggravation, you should return a verdict of death. And that seems to me another way of saying there is a presumption that if aggravation and mitigation are equal, that the penalty should be death."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"The State has made a judgment that this particular offense -- what's it called?

Because the way I'm thinking about this, I'm making two assumptions 1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 that I'd like you to make: first, that there could be such a case, which I very much doubt, but -- but this is a lawyer's hypothetical, this whole thing, in a sense. But I'll make the assumption there could be such a case. Second, I will assume that our case law leaves this open, a matter that can be argued. But suppose that we do make that assumption for the moment. Then what I'm thinking of is this made-up case is the case of the following. We have aggravating factors and break them down into molecules on a scale, and for every molecule of aggravation here, there is a molecule of mitigation there, so that the juror who is very conscientious ends up with the same number of molecules of equal weight on this scale. And in our made-up instance, Kansas says, if that's the situation, you must say death. Now, if that's the case, how would you reconcile that with a view of the eighth amendment that says if you're going to sentence someone to death, there has to be something special about his case that means it's somewhat worse than the ordinary case because, after all, for every molecule of specialness that warranted death, we have a molecule of mitigation that doesn't? So that's where I am, trying to get the cases 1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 out of it and trying to take very seriously the hypothetical that is before us."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"The Furman -- the -- it's hard to tell where the voice is coming from, I 1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 know.

I have no doubt you can go through the language and show that. And it's designed to say, but the very point of those cases is you do not send someone to death unless the jury decides that the circumstances here make him somewhat worse, at least one molecule worth of worse, than the typical person. And given the evenness of the balance, I don't see how we can say that, though I grant you, when you go back 1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 to those words in the cases, you're right."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Of course, the -- the instructions don't tell the jury to weigh the molecules.

I want to ask you one question that goes back to your colloquy with Justice Souter and Justice Scalia. Justice Scalia pointed out that the State has made a moral judgment on a certain state of facts, the death penalty shall be imposed and which you agreed with. And that was true in the cases back in 1975 and There were some State statutes that mandated death based on the moral judgment of the State in certain circumstances.
