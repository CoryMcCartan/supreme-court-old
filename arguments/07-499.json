We had a colloquy earlier on -- on the extent of the reliance by the BIA for its general policy on Fedorenko, and what the does a see cite mean and so on. But in -- in this particular case, going to page 6a or 7a from which Mr. Pincus was -- was earlier quoting, if you look on page 7a, the reason that Fedorenko is thought to be appropriate here is, he - - that is to say, the Petitioner here -- has not demonstrated his conduct is distinguishable from that of the alien in that case. The conduct of the alien in that case was identified as relevant by the voluntary/involuntary distinction. It was so identified because of the text of the statute, voluntary was used in one place; it wasn't used in the place where the bar was set up. So that it seems to me that by the express reasoning in this case, this case is governed by a rule that in effect says the distinction between voluntary and involuntary action is not a relevant distinction. So I don't thin k you can get by in this case without confronting just what Justice Breyer says.
