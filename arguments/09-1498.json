It's talking about the computation of the start date for the trial.  So if that's what that commands you to do, doesn't -- isn't only the Solicitor General's position consistent with that?

Now, the virtue of that  is just what Justice Ginsburg started with; all the trial judges know how to do it; the lawyers don't get mixed up; and the problem with what you're arguing for, in my mind -- if you want to say anything more about it, do -- is that it seems very unworkable to strike trying to figure out what causes what."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":3,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Why do you think that --"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":3,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"-- your motion -- I mean, the government had administrative motions, but you had a Speedy Trial Act motion; and you say that doesn't count, either?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":4,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Counsel, I don't believe I had a trial in my district court days where between  the time I had the pretrial conference and the time trial started, there wasn't a slew of motions, because that's about the time counsel tends to wake up."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":4,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Okay?
