He can pay it on a payment schedule, on any -- in any way that the court wants him to pay it.  So I don't know why we're in (b)(1) or (b)(2) at all because I don't see where the impracticality comes in.  Answer that. But then, secondly, it's not clear to me that we're thinking about this right.

If we're letting them recoup the expenses of sale, why don't we just simply recognize the value on that date?  And if an investor who takes property inadequately decides to hold on to it or -- or with no reasonableness holds on to it or gives it away to their mother or sells it to somebody for a nominal fee, then it should be the date at which they got rid of it or the day -- or the value of the date -- on the date of return or something like that, or the date that they should have done something with the property.

That's why I say that reading it that way to me doesn't make much sense, and therefore, I think this Alderson Reporting Company is a case of A; it is a case where he's simply ordered return the 100,000, and there is implicit in that you don't have to return more than she -- than you took, and you already gave her the bat.

Maybe you'll tell me this is the wrong way of looking at it.

So one way of looking at this is which party bears the risk that there is going to be a significant deterioration in the real estate market between the time of foreclosure and the time of sale?

Why would Congress want that?"},{"name":"JUSTICE ALITO","id":8,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"But real estate isn't completely liquid, and so it takes some time to sell it.
