Townsend. Mr. McCreadie. "},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Mr. McCreadie, in this case, why is it necessary to get into that, whether they are punitive damages under FELA and the Jones Act? If we accept, as I think we must, Townsend's allegations to be true, he has said that Atlantic, as a matter of routine, puts in a boilerplate complaint for declaratory relief, reciting all the reasons why somebody could not get maintenance and cure, even though that is patently false, the allegation for example that he deserted his post. He says it's false. He said the allegation that he falsified his application for employment is false. Accepting the -- that to be true at this stage, isn't there some kind of punitive measure to be taken against a litigant who abuses the court process in that way?"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Yes, but -- but now we're at the pretrial stage, and we're supposed to assume the truth of the allegations in Townsend's complaint. We're assuming -- they may well turn out to be false; but at the threshold under 12(b)6 we accept those allegations as true and then determine whether a claim is stated."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"But let's take this out of the maintenance and cure spot altogether. Litigation generally, if a court determines that a litigant is abusing the court's process by filing false pleadings, is there a remedy; and if so, what is it?"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"I thought that all that was at stake there was whether the employer wrongfully withheld maintenance and cure that was owing. The allegations made by Townsend go far beyond that they just unreasonably denied him maintenance and cure. They suggest that this litigant, as a matter practice, standard operating procedure, makes false claims before a court. And my question to you is, isn't across the board there a sanction, wholly apart from the particular claim, for a litigant who abuses the court's processes?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Is any of them called punitive damages?

So what if a person makes these terrible allegations, but ends up winning the case anyway, and -- and -- well, you couldn't impose punitive damages."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"We've got to call it something else, don't we?"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"How many - -"},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":5,"spokeBefore":3,"sideBefore":"justices","text":"But do you read Vaughan v. Atkinson as necessarily implying punitive damages would be inappropriate? I can't quite find the negative that you want me to find, I think, in Atkinson. True, they didn't talk about punitive damages. They said damages are appropriate, and attorneys' fees in this case, which is what the district court gave, we are going to affirm it. But there's nothing there that said punitive damages are inappropriate."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Whose dissent was that? I have forgotten that. Whose dissent was it? Do you recall? Stewart?"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"You said never in the history. I mean, there -- there are examples like the ancient Nancy case, where the damages, where they were called exemplary -- but when you say never has there been before or after punitive awards. But there is precedent, the Nancy case in this Court, cases in lower courts, there have been punitive damages awards in -- in maintenance and cure cases."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Did this Court ever hold that under FELA or under the Jones Act there are no punitive damages? Do we have any holding to that effect?"},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":5,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"But that -- but that was a common law wrongful death action, correct, Miles?"},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":5,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"It was not admiralty maintenance and cure."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Excuse me, that the maintenance and cure claim could proceed or that the punitive damages claim could be made?"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Mr. McCreadie, there's a question about this case, a troublesome feature of it. That is, you are saying because there are no punitive damages available under FELA and under the Jones Act, then there certainly should not be any under maintenance and cure. But if we have to answer those questions, whether there are punitive damages available under FELA and the Jones Act, in the context of a maintenance and cure claim, then we're deciding a much larger question than are punitive damages available for willful refusal to pay maintenance and cure. We're deciding a question under the Jones Act, a question under the FELA, and there are a lot of people who would be interested -- and the seamen are a sizable group that the law cares about particularly. But there would be a larger interest, a larger interest in the answer in the Jones Act context and FELA. And to decide those questions in a case that doesn't present any claim under FELA or any claim under the Jones Act is troublesome."},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":5,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"As I read your reply brief -- and please correct me if it's a misimpression -- you didn't dispute the fact that punitive damages were available historically for the shipowner's wrongful refusal to provide maintenance and cure, or am I wrong about that?"},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":5,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"And what about English admiralty, under the English precedents?"},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":5,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Of course, in Miles - - again, we're coming back -- was wrongful death, not maintenance and cure."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Of course, your friend on the other side distinguishes that argument by noting that death is different.

Wasn't that the case?"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"But that's what the common law was. That's why we had Lord Campbell's Act. That was if you die, too bad; if you're injured, you collect. That was fixed by statute on the high seas, DOHSA. Because there was the gap, there was no Lord Campbell's Act, the Court effectively made one up, right? That's what it did in Moragne."},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":5,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"But I just -- and you can go ahead and answer that question without my interrupting. But my assumption from reading the amicus briefs in this case is that punitive damages were awarded in some maintenance and cure cases (a) as simply part of the overall award -- they weren't separated out, but it was part of the measure -- and (b) that some American courts, American judges, including noted admiralty judges, awarded in some cases punitive damages in maintenance and cure before the modern cases Moragne and so forth -- and Miles -- that you're talking about. Is that incorrect?"},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":5,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"I'm talking pre-Miles.

And -- and now he's going to be out that attorneys' fees as a result of his sickness. So I understand that. Punitives does not compensate him for anything. It is a policy matter for the State. He's a beneficiary of a windfall.
