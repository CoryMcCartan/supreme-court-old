If you have probable cause to think that there's evidence of a crime even in the glove compartment or underneath the seat, you can look at it without a warrant. Why do you need this as well? You say we need this as well because the guy who's locked up in back of the squad car might take off the handcuffs, open the door, run out, and grab a gun from under the glove compartment. That's a little thin. And then you say, well, the rule is it needs to be administrable.
