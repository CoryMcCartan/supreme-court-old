So, if the other weren't taxing, there wouldn't be any question, that the tribe can tax and the State can tax.  But the two can't coexist, because the consumer's not going to pay the price.  So, only one can.  And the issue is, which one dominates, and which is one is subordinate?  But you have unquestionable authority to tax in both.
