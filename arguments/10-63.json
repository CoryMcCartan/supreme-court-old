And the question that I would like to ask is whether this -- the -- whether you as the Solicitor General or the Attorney General of Alabama have anAlderson Reporting Company obligation to push this matter in this way.  This is a case where -- as I said, it's a capital case, as we all recognize.  Mr. Maples has lost his right to appeal through no fault of his own, through a series of very unusual and unfortunate circumstances.
