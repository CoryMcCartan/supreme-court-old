All right. So, it seems to me, looking at these three sections, as soon as you get to (a)(2), it says certain matter are not subject to judicial review, and it includes 1225(b)(1), which I take it is the case where somebody comes in, knocks at our door, and the immigration judge says good-bye and he says, no, no, I am entitled to be a refugee or asylum. Now, we look at that, it says in there it's subsection (e) gives you judicial review of that. Now we look at the thing you cited which is (5) -- (a)(5), and you read it completely correctly, but you left out these words \"except as provided in subsection (e).\" So now we go to subsection (e). And lo and behold, what is subsection (e) talking about, but just the case I have mentioned. It talks about -- it talks about judicial review for orders under 1225(b)(1). Now, those are the people who knock at the door and they want asylum. And there is some procedures for them. So, now we look at (e) to see what are the procedures for them. And lo and behold, right there in (2), it says you can have a habeas corpus procedure as to certain matters, whether he is an alien, whether he has been admitted as a refugee, et cetera. So it says there are some you can have habeas corpus. So I imagine a person who has been ordered removed under (e). All right. Now it says you can have a habeas corpus and now the judge says good-bye. And they go to a reviewing court, which is going to be a habeas corpus court, and that court decides, the alien is right, I am going to issue an injunction. Now, just in case he's thinking that, in the very next section (f), what we have are two provisions, (f)(1) that says if his case is a case involving mass action against the whole thing, you can't enter an injunction. And then we look at (2), and it says if his is just a normal case, you can't enter an injunction unless it meets this specific standard. So I looked at that. And I admit this is pretty quick, and I thought it's (e) and it's (f), and (f) is dealing with (e), (f)(2). And it makes perfect sense. They don't want a habeas corpus judge telling that immigration judge what to do with the guy knocking on the door and saying \"I need asylum,\" unless they meet clear and present danger -- clear and -- whatever it is, clear and present -- yeah. Okay. Now, I will admit I read that quickly. And therefore, I am probably missing something. And I don't expect you necessarily to be an expert, but can you do your best to tell me what I am missing or if you think I might be right?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":8,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"What it says here specifically is it says habeas proceedings."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":8,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Well, let me add one other thing, because all I am trying to do is find some work for this section (f)(2) to do. And I think I found some. And I think what you say is wait a minute, we agree it's like habeas. But and I think it would be like an exclusion order rather than a removal order. And I did notice previously when it talks about 1225, sometimes it uses the word \"exclusion\" and sometimes it says \"removal.\" But if you were that district habeas judge and you get a thing saying removal, you don't really vacate it.

In other words, the substantial evidence standard is keyed to what a reasonable factfinder could find reasonably, based upon substantial evidence. Is the substantial evidence sufficient for such a factfinder to find by a preponderance that this person has failed to meet, or, put it the other way around, that the factfinder has unreasonably failed to find that the Petitioner has met the standard?
