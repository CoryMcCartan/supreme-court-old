And the Court has defined what is inside that sphere as anything that is part of the due functioning of the legislative process. And when an employee is an alter ego, that is, a second self of a member, that employee by definition is actually performing part of the member's job.

Okay? And then on paragraph 14 they say on November 15th, 2001, Mr. Hanson -- just as you said -- planned a Senate Government Affairs Committee meeting, selected hearing witnesses and prepared questions. Now suppose that we did as the court, lower court wanted to do, say let's just see if that becomes relevant. Because it's possible, given his other tasks that those two incidents, one on November 15th and the other, whenever help he gave to the drafting, had nothing to do with his being fired and nobody claims that.

In the sphere at the moment is totally empty. The Senator's gone. Everybody knows that this, this office of Senator Mark Dayton is a totally fictional construct.

But I'm not sure about the careful way. They in effect said, you know, if this gets into Speech or Debate Clause issues they prevail. And that kind of just leaves us with no solution for the problem that Justice Stevens raised and that I'm concerning with, unless there's, there's going to be an automatic dismissal when the member says, look, I cannot respond to this without getting into, into acts within the legislative process which are privileged.
