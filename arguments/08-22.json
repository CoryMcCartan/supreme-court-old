It's not exactly the way that brief did, but I see the problem that you are -- that you are addressing as -- as not only a procedural, but certainly to a degree a substantive due process kind of problem. One of the factors that goes into the recognition of at least a substantive limitation when there has been none before is -- is the issue of timing. Is the political process in fact working now toward a solution? Because if it is, that kind of ethos of total unreasonability is -- is still being worked out, and - - and the courts ought to stay their hands. So my question is, what do you say to the argument that there is a political process going on addressing this issue? And I forget the details, but my recollection is that it may well have been that brief pointed out that the State of West Virginia itself has enacted some legislation since these events began to transpire.
