But what we're going to discover, I suspect, when we actually dig into this record, which is pretty extensive, are two things. The first is the California Court of Appeals does not seem to have dealt with the particular issue in front of us. They talked about a due process issue at the end of their paragraph, they have talked about things that are close to it, but they nowhere say expressly how they are deciding the question of whether there was ineffective assistance of counsel for the reason that he didn't put on this insanity defense. That's going to be our first problem. Then I looked to see, I got the record out to see, if he raised it, and he didn't. So we have the fact that they didn't talk about it, and then we have the fact that of course the Supreme Court of California says just one word, \"Denied.\" Then when we discover round two in the Ninth Circuit, we are going to discover some language which says: We are not relying on this rule, there is no such rule, as a rule of you have to make a defense as a last resort. Here's what they say. Instead of that we say, forget about that, we were wrong the first time, we assume. \"Where the State court has provided an adjudication on the merits, that is, it did say denied, but has not explained its underlying reasoning or held an evidentiary hearing, we conduct an independent review of the record to determine the State court's final resolution of the case, whether it was reasonable or unreasonable.\" So they say: We did conduct that record independent review. And our conclusion is that it was unreasonable, okay? Nothing to do with any special rule here or anything. We just think it was unreasonable. All right; now, what are we supposed to do with this?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":8,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"What is that deference going to be?

Is that what we should do?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":8,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Yes."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":8,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Then we have to reach this hearing issue because we have to say, insofar as the hearing reached a different result, we should ignore it for the reason that the statute tells us to consider the reasonableness of the State court's decision in light of the facts on the record before it."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":8,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"So we have to reach a huge number of issues which we've never decided."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":8,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Well, then how are we supposed to do it? That's why I raised it."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":6,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"We should treat the district court proceeding as though it had never happened on the ground that the Ninth Circuit never should have remanded it to the district court, and we just take it as though we had a 2254 petition from the State supreme court in the district court. And then the district court doesn't conduct any hearing; it just applies the standard. So that the whole thing about clearly erroneous at the district court, that -- that should be out of the case."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":5,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Then if we get to that point, I think your argument is as follows. I'm not sure. I want you to tell me. If the State court adjudication was -- was contrary to what Justice Stevens' hypo suggested might be the \"total fool\" rule, in other words no one but a complete nincompoop would have failed to -- to press forward with this defense, then we can decide the case simply under Strickland, because Strickland unreasonableness is certainly going to cover the total fool case. But if we have something less egregious than the total fool case, then we've got to look for more precise Supreme Court precedent, and that's what gets us into the Musladin or Musladin rule."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":5,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"And if we get to the Musladin sort of level of generality, we do not have any determination from this Court, any clearly established law from this Court, that would indicate that the State court's adjudication or determination was unreasonable here."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":5,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Is that your road map?"},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Thank you, counsel.

And it doesn't seem to me that that follows at all. If there's no Strickland error, that seems to me a -- a -- an odd premise to say you ought to remand for a hearing.

Because I look at that. I think when I go back and see what was the evidence in front of them, I am going to find all of these -- all of these things. Not the last part by the way, not -- not the part about the counsel admitting he was wrong or whatever this argument we are having. We won't find that, but we'll find everything else there. And so they're using that as the basis to say there was no prejudice, and now I guess that the Ninth Circuit and the Federal courts would have to defer to that finding on prejudice.
