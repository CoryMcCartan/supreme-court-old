But the -- the issue here, as I see it -- which maybe will take a second -- is there are four cases that say we don't have to reach these grand questions. All we have to do is decide what the source of power is. Now their argument is that even if you go back to the Foraker Act, which indeed did have the people of Puerto Rico making laws, and if you then add the Resolution which delegated the authority to make the Constitution, the Constitution itself which speaks of \"We the People\" of Puerto Rico making a law, the fact that later Congress and the President said Puerto Rico has a Republican form of government, the fact that subsequent to that we went to the United Nations and had them withdraw the requirement to report on a colony because Puerto Rico is not a colony -- - and you know the words as well as I, and they sure sound like \"sovereign.\" Alderson Reporting Company And in Valle, which no one mentions, Trias Monge wrote that in fact all these laws -- and he was talking about civil, but I suppose it applies to Commonwealth too -- are to be interpreted in light of the civil code tradition of Europe, which was the tradition that applied prior to 1900, and not the common law. I don't see, when you put all those things together, if you're looking at the facts of what the law of Puerto Rico is in the area, it sounds to me like it's civil code coming out of a constitution which I grant you was given by authority of Congress.
