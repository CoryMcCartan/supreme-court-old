And I don't care if all the commission says is, you know, there is some reason to believe that they were lying.  Even if it's that minimal, you are forcing them, and it is pretty sure that it's going to happen because somebody will complain, the candidate they are criticizing, you are forcing them to go through this procedure in the midst of an election campaign, right?

Don't you think there's a serious First Amendment concern with a state law that requires you to come before a commission to justify what you are going to say and which gives the commission discovery power to find out who's involved in your association, what research you've made, et cetera?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":9,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Why? Why?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":9,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Why can't a person say, you know, there are things I want to say politically, and the Constitution says that the State does not have the right to abridge my speech, and I intend to say them. And if I say them, there's a serious risk that I will be had up before a commission and could be fined. What's the harm? I can't speak. That's the harm. Right? So why isn't that end of the matter?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":9,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Why shouldn't it be the harm? That is, whatever -- has any case said when somebody says, we’re going to take an extreme, you want to speak in a campaign, and we have a law here that if you do we will throw you in jail and you really do want to speak and the law really does prevent you from speaking, why shouldn't that be the end of it?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":9,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Well, I'm saying is there a Alderson Reporting Company statute -- not a statute.   Is there a case which says the little syllogism I just went through is not the law of the United States?   Now, there may be.  That's why I asked the question."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":4,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"But that was a very special situation.   In Golden they were going out after a particular candidate.

Mr. Carvin said it's a very short time.   They're brought before the commission, they have to answer this charge that they lied, that they made a false statement.   And that just that alone is going to diminish the effect of their speech because they have been labeled false speakers, and it costs money to defend before the commission, right?   That's not --"},{"name":"JUSTICE KAGAN","id":7,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Well, I'm not sure it's a reputational harm.   I mean, why isn't, as Justice Ginsburg suggested, the relevant harm the probable cause determination itself?   There are voters out there and they don't know that probable cause is such a low bar as you describe it.   They think probable cause means you probably lied, and that seems a reasonable thing for them to think and that's a relevant harm and we should just -- you know, we don't even need the prosecution to serve as the relevant harm.   That seems quite enough."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"I guess it was in the case of COAST; the problem is other people are going to be intimidated from helping them engage in their political speech.   What was it, a billboard?  The billboard company said --"},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"-- I'm not going to let you put your sign up on my billboard, I might be liable.   So, I mean, they may have a certain fortitude and proceeding based on all the reasons that you've given, but they need third parties to help carry out their message and there is no reason to think those third parties have any commitment to their political message at all and the slightest whiff of, oh, this is going to be legal trouble, they say, forget about it."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Well, no, but a defamation action, people sue everybody all the time. No one's going to take that seriously.   In fact, it's probably going to redound to the benefit of SBA and COAST to say the congressman is, you know, bringing a defamation action.   It highlights it, but it's another thing to have the State involved making a determination that there's probable cause that you lied."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":8,"spokeBefore":3,"sideBefore":"justices","text":"The mere fact that a private individual can chill somebody's speech does not say, well, since a private individual can do it, you know, the ministry of truth can do it.   That's not -- that's not the law."},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":6,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"There's a curious inversion here.   Usually we're concerned about citizen suits, too many people can challenge -- challenge the law.   Here we're concerned that many, many citizens can bring the challenge against the candidate.   So it's somewhat reversed.   In other words, you have tens of thousands of private attorney generals waiting to pounce and get these people before the commission and have to follow discovery orders."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":5,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Do you know of the 500 cases that you mentioned earlier, how many actually ended up in full prosecutions?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":5,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Three what?

You understand it better than I.   I'm just making up an example.   Do you think they'd prosecute this or not?

So why --"},{"name":"JUSTICE ALITO","id":10,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Well, why don't the statistics that you provided us portray a system that Alderson Reporting Company really limits core First Amendment speech without providing much of an opportunity for a judicial review if you're correct about -- about Article III here where -- you have a system where thousands of complaints are filed, and yet in the end, there's very few prosecutions.   And you say, well, the filing of the complaint isn't enough and the probable cause determination isn't enough.   So you have this system that goes on and on, year after year, where arguably there's a great chilling of -- of core First Amendment speech, and yet you're saying that basically you can't get into Federal court."},{"name":"JUSTICE KAGAN","id":7,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Well, but how would you get into Federal court?   I mean, your own office expresses grave concern about the constitutionality of this statute.   So that suggests somebody should be able to get into Federal court to do this.   But I don't see a way where you would allow a pre-enforcement challenge. One would have to go through the entire process and get to the end of it and get a judgment to enable a Alderson Reporting Company challenge under your theory; is that right?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":9,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"I had a reason for asking what sounds like a silly hypothetical, but a possible one.   We understand how people take different views on that.   And then you have a hard time, it seems to me, distinguishing this case from that one in terms of their exercising their authority.   And so at least it must raise a question, a First Amendment question on the merits.   It seems pretty serious.  So if you lose on this procedural matter, how quickly can you get this Alderson Reporting Company decided?   I mean, there are elections coming up.  People would like to know.   They want to know what they're supposed to say.   And how long is all this procedural skirmishing going to take, which in and of itself is an obstacle to what they might say in the next election?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":9,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"I mean, you're saying, well, they don't have standing -- you know, I was interested in this field, administrative law, and even my class, despite the scintillation, would sometimes go to sleep when I got to such questions.

I'll repeat myself.   The elections are coming up.  And people have to know what they're supposed to say and what they can say and what they can't.   So how do we get this decided?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":9,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"It is suggesting that. I agree, it is suggesting that."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":9,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Well, I would say one of the purposes of standing is to allow people who are really going to be hurt to be able to be heard in court.   Well, of course, if they're not going to be hurt, there's no reason.   And what the merits discussion is designed to suggest is that there are real people who would really like to speak in an election campaign.   And if they feel they can't, they are really being hurt.   That's what the other side is arguing.  And I've listened to the argument.   I'm curious as to the practicalities.
