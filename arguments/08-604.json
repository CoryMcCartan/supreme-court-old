Now, if you are willing to make that giant step, the remaining issue in the case is whether the procedure here was fair or unfair. And the Seventh Circuit is filled with pages of opinion that explains why it was unfair. And the reason basically it was unfair is because no one in his right mind previous to this case would have thought that you should fill up your brief with a lot of facts that nobody's going to contest. And after this case, the board said: By the way, you have to put in a whole lot of jurisdictional facts even if nobody is going to contest them, and since you didn't do it, you are out, and we won't even give you a chance to do it now.
