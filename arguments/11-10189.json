It was an equitable rule about giving people an opportunity to raise a trial ineffectiveness claim. And if it's true that, although Texas has a technical possibility of doing that outside of collateral review, but, in fact, that the lawyers are told not to use that route, that the lawyers don't use that route, that, if they do use that route, the likelihood is that they will be thrown out for using that route, the question is why that -- the formal availability of a mechanism that nobody uses and that everybody is told not to use should matter with respect to the application of an equitable rule like Martinez?"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":3,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Has there ever been such a case, any case in which a direct appeal counsel has been held ineffective for failing to present a Wiggins claim?"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":3,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"But I asked, if there was any decisions that says, you should have raised it on appeal, appeals counsel didn't rely on the advice of the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, and, therefore, because counsel followed the advice of Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, she was ineffective?"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":3,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Well, the -- the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, in addition to saying, as a general rule, bring it up on -- on collateral review, said -- and there's a reason.  The reason why is the undeveloped record on direct appeal would be insufficient to establish claims that must be supported by extra-record evidence.
