And if you do, I don't know whether GERA simply picked up whatever saving of the equal protection otherwise would have existed in the ADEA or didn't.  And I believe that GERA applies to employment discrimination claims based on gender or race or other things, right? Well, every circuit in the country has said you don't lose your -- your constitutional claim there. So are we supposed to read GERA, it goes this way in some cases and that way in other cases, when GERA is silent on the matter? And so I looked to see what the Seventh Circuit said.  Nothing.  I looked to see what you argued below.  Nothing.  I looked to see whether it's obvious that GERA does apply or doesn't apply and simply picks it up or not.  I don't know.  Maybe I'm just being thick.

You have to say yes or no because, if you're going to say -- I mean, you know, let's either do it or not do it.  If you -- if you want to leave this issue in the case, it's possible to argue we should decide this whole issue on the ground that, although he's not really a bird, he's a fish or whatever.

And -- and you won based on a factual record that was no different then than it is now.  You asked for this ruling based on these facts, you won, and now, you want to insulate that from any review. I mean, I think it'd -- it'd be a feather in your cap if you can pull it off.  But it seems to me -- (Laughter.)"},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"justices","text":"It seems to me that, since you asked for the ruling on the merits and got it, we ought to be able to review it, to determine whether it's right or wrong.  And to the extent there's a factual issue that would persist in the case, if it goes back on qualified immunity, you and the parties can reposition themselves on that. I mean, it is an issue that was apparently close enough for one district court to say, yes, the other district court, on looking at it again, to say no. The deck will be reshuffled depending on how we rule.

If ultimately there was another appeal, maybe it would go to a different Seventh Circuit panel.  Maybe it would come out differently. So you want that wiped away.        And you want us to hold only -- to limit our consideration to the ADEA and not consider GERA, so that would be back in the case when it came -- when it went back to the district court.

And what she wrote, to my recollection, is, well, we would like the advice of the lower court if they want to give it. And so we send it back for the Third Circuit Alderson Reporting Company to consider whether it's appropriate to reach the issue and, if it is appropriate to reach the issue, do so. Or, if they think the district court should reach it, do so.  In other words, we can't figure it out at this moment what's fair in terms of the entire litigation.

That's the way the case was litigated. That's the way they decided.  The broad statement, whether he's an employee or not an employee, he doesn't have a 1983 -- he has a 1983 action.

Instead, you have to argue that this remedial scheme displaces a preexisting statutory or constitutional right.  And when we've had that situation in the past, we've looked to more than just the remedial scheme itself. You know, Smith looks to the language of the statute, which refers to constitutional claims.  It looks to legislative history.  It looks to the coincidence between the statute -- the new statutory claim and the old constitutional claim.  And it seems to me that you don't have any of those things. All you have is a complicated remedial scheme, which would be enough to say, look, you can't bring 1983 suits to vindicate this statute.  But seems as though it's not enough under our case law to repeal preexisting rights and remedies."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"But why -- if the ADEA is expanding the Civil Rights protection against age discrimination much more generous to the employee, isn't it strange to think that Congress, at the same time, wanted employees to have these expanded rights and to do away with the preexisting remedy?"},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Thank you, counsel."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"The case is submitted."}],"people":[{"id":0,"fullName":"MICHAEL A.
