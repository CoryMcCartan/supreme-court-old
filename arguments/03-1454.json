I'm not an expert. I don't honestly know, if I really think about it, despite all the papers and so forth, whether it's true that medical marijuana is helpful to people in ways that pills are not. I really don't know. So I would have thought that the people, like your clients, who have a strong view about it, would go to the FDA, and they would say to the FDA, \"FDA, take this off the list. You must take it off the list if it has an accepted medical use and it isn't lacking in safety.\" The FDA will say yes or it will say no. If it says yes, they win. If they say no, they can come right into court and say, \"That's an abuse of discretion.\" The Court says yes or no. If it says yes, they win. If it says no, it must be because it wasn't an abuse of discretion, in which case, I, as a judge, and probably as a person, would think it isn't true that marijuana has some kind of special use. So that would seem to me to be the obvious way to get what they want. That seems to me to be relevant to the correct characterization. And while the FDA can make mistakes, I guess medicine by regulation is better than medicine by referendum. 1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":8,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"So that's -- I just want to know why."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":8,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"That's all true, but as long as that hasn't been done, don't I have to take this case on the assumption that there is no such thing as medical marijuana that's special and necessary?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":8,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"If has been done, maybe I shouldn't make it."},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":5,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Are prescriptions, under California law, limited only to those people with life- threatening illnesses?"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":6,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Some of the illnesses - -"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":6,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"In one -- in one plaintiff's case, I think, there isn't a life-threatening - -"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":6,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"May I just ask you one procedural question?"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":6,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"And this is -- this is a suit for an injunction.
