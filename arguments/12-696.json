We draw strength from his resurrection.  Blessed are you who has raised up the Lord Jesus.  You who will raise us in our turn and put us by his side.

Maybe you'll say it's a lot different from what the Town of Greece does. First of all, this town starts out by making -- by proceeding in a more systematic and Alderson Reporting Company comprehensive way in recruiting chaplains for the month or whatever it is.  So, instead of just looking to all the houses of worship within the town, it identifies places of worship that may be outside the town boundaries that people within the town who adhere to a minority religion may attend. And it makes it clear that it's open to chaplains of any religious -- of any religion on a rotating basis.  And then they have -- they structure their proceedings so that you have the prayer, and then the legislative part of the town meeting. And then there's a clear separation in time and access between that part of the proceeding and the hearing where variances and things of that nature are held.

They are there as citizens. Alderson Reporting Company The judges here are not -- we're not here as citizens.  And as citizens, they bring, they bring to their job all of -- all of the predispositions that citizens have. And these people perhaps invoke the deity at meals.  They should not be able to invoke it before they undertake a serious governmental task such as enacting laws or ordinances? There -- there is a serious religious interest on the other side of this thing that -- that -- that people who have religious beliefs ought to be able to invoke the deity when they are acting as citizens, and not -- not as judges or as experts in -- in the executive branch. And it seems to me that, when they do that, so long as all groups are allowed to be in, there seems to me -- it seems to me an imposition upon them to -- to stifle the manner in which they -- they invoke their deity."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":10,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Are you -- I would like you to take into account an aspect of this.

But one -- a major purpose of the religion clauses is to allow people in this country of different religion, including those of no religion, to live harmoniously together. Now, given that basic purpose, what do we do about the problem of prayer in these kinds of legislative sessions?  One possibility is say, you just can't do it, it's secular.  But that is not our tradition."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":10,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"All right.  The second possibility is the one that you are advocating.  And it has much to recommend it, try to keep non-denominational, try to make it as inoffensive to the others as possible.  That's the upside. Alderson Reporting Company The downside is seeing supervised by a judge, dozens of groups, and today, there are 60 or 70 groups of different religions coming in and saying, no, that doesn't work for us, this doesn't work for us, and that's the nightmare that they are afraid of. I mean, even in this town or in the area, there are significant numbers, as well as Christians, of Jews, of Muslims, of Baha'is, of Hindus, and others. All right.        So there's a third approach, and that is say, well, you can't have them if there's any aspect of coercion.  But we just saw people walking into this room, \"God save the United States,\" and you want to win your case.  I didn't see people sitting down. All right.        Then the fourth approach, which is the other that has -- makes its appearance here, is to say let's try to be inclusive.  Now, was enough -- in other words, so you didn't get the right prayer today, but you -- and even with the nonreligious, you know many believe in the better angels of our nature and the spiritual side of humankind; it's not impossible to appeal to them.  So you say, you'll have your chance. And that's the thing I -- I would like you to explore.  I mean, is there a way of doing that, or is that preferable to the other ways, or do we get into trouble? Alderson Reporting Company"},{"name":"JUSTICE ALITO","id":9,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Well, that gets exactly to Alderson Reporting Company the -- that gets exactly to the problem with your argument about nonsectarian prayer.  Yes, when -- at the beginning of the country, the population was 98 percent-plus Protestant.  Then it became predominantly Christian.  Then it became predominant -- almost exclusively Christian and Jewish. And it -- but now, it's not that -- it's -- it's gone much further than that.  So we have a very religiously diverse country.  There are a lot of Muslims, there are a lot of Hindus, there are Buddhists, there are Baha'is, there are all sorts of other adherents to all sorts of other religions.

This goes back to what Justice Breyer suggested. Part of what we are trying to do here is to maintain a multi-religious society in a peaceful and harmonious way.
