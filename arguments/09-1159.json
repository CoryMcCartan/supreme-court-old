I mean, the -- the brief that I found very, very interesting is that filed by the Association of American Universities and the Advancement For Science  and the Council on Education, and they seem to take the line that you are -- I don't know how far you want to pursue it. They say the strongest analogy is with government employees, and if you look at government employees the basic rule is, the Federal Government paid for it, they should have the invention.  And the way they do it is not to deny the employee the right to have the invention, but they insist upon an assignment, assignment of an exclusive license. And there are cases which are cited here that suggest that, even if the employee tries to run his way around that and simply goes and before the government can get it assigns the interest to a third party, that that third party assignment is void as a matter of public policy; and that the assignment to the government of the exclusive right is valid as a matter of law, a legal implication from the executive order in the circumstance. That brings me back to where Justice Ginsburg was, and Justice Kennedy.  The analogy is so strong.  The government has paid for it.  There is a statute here that really seems to assume, though not explicitly say, that the universities will have title -- that we simply copy what happened in this other area and  say that an effort to assign by the employee in contravention of what this statute takes as its basic assumption, and a contract, is void as a matter of public policy, because the exclusive license is assumed to be assumed -- to be assigned to the university, though I don't need the second part; for this case, the first part suffices."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":10,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Is that before the executive order or after?"},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Well, but the problem with --"},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Are you finished answering Justice Breyer?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":10,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"No, no.
