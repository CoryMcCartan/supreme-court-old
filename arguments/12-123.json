And so they're there with some raisins, and then the government says, do this thing with your raisins.  And they don't want to do it, so they don't. They don't do it even though the law says do it.

It seems to me that as to the penalty part, the key thing is that if they had handed over the raisins, they could have gone to the Court of Federal Claims and had the compensation done there.

And they think as a matter of policy that just hurts people by raising prices, and as a matter of constitutional law it takes raisins from some people that belong to them and uses them for this bad purpose.Page 37 Okay, that's their view of it, something like that, isn't it?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":9,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Fine.  So they're making that kind of constitutional claim.  Now, I would think if all you told me was that and I knew nothing about all these statutes, I would say that's the kind of claim that should be made in a Federal district court, period, not the Court of Claims.  Because their government isn't going to compensate them for anything.  That's against the whole point of the program. Either this program is valid or it isn't. And if it isn't, some authoritative set of courts should tell us that.  So I have a feeling this is somehow not a right fit with the Court of Claims.

I think that's what Justice Breyer says. Did -- did Congress create a statute in which we're going to take your raisins and then you can go to the Court of Claims and get your money back.  I mean, that -- that surely is not what Congress contemplated. The -- the whole notion of the program is you can't get your money back in the Court of Claims. Now, if you're raising a constitutional objection, that's something else.  That should be done in district court.  But to say that Congress contemplated -- you know, we'll take your raisins and then you sue in the Court of Claims, they give you your money back.  That's a weird statute."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":4,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"And you -- you think that's a close question?  You think that the way the statute is supposed to operate, once it is held that this is an unconstitutional taking, is that every year, the government takes the raisins and every year, the grower goes to the Court of Claims and gets the money back for the raisins.  Is that the program that Congress anticipated?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":4,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"I don't think it's close atPage 40 all.  That's a crazy statute.

What's the purpose of that?"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":6,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Mr. Palmore, am I incorrect in thinking that the government is saying, handlers cannot raise the constitutionality of the Raisin Marketing Order?  You've told us that the producers can go to the Court of Claims.  What about the handlers?  They're at least being fined for violating the Act, and it's their position that the whole thing is unconstitutional.

And certainly not the taxpayer, he's not going to pay it, and maybe the other producers will pay, some who get gypped or something, I don't know.
