But in the pandering statute, what we've got here is there is -- as you put it earlier, there is an understanding which happens to be correct, objectively correct, that there is child porn, and there is a very clear intent to convey that message by way of presenting this material to a third party, in this case the police.

In other words, your client is relying -- he didn't produce Lolita. You're relying on the effect on other people, and that is what our overbreadth doctrine allows, if there's a substantial amount of speech that's protected.

Your answer was well, there would still be some examples not covered.

Somewhere out there there would be an example not covered that would be the basis for an as-applied challenge, but there wouldn't be substantial overbreadth. And isn't that the case?

This Court is not generally in the business of writing appendices that say well, the statute couldn't apply in this situation, and it couldn't apply and as long as we put those contours around it. Certainly the Court could write an opinion that would inform Congress why this particular statute as written is overbroad, and explain what kind of statute wouldn't be overbroad. But for the Court itself, I think that that -- I don't know any instance in which we have provided that kind of appendix that said things that are like Traffic, they're okay, and things that are like something else are not okay.

I assume whatever you put in an appendix, saying all these other situations that are not before us are not covered. Isn't that the most blatant dictum?

It -- it rests upon our determination in this case, which involves somebody who undoubtedly was selling child porn, and a horrible kind of child porn -- we say in this case, oh, we can -- we can contemplate other cases, where we would not hold the person guilty.

But it -- as I read the Solicitor General's interpretation of the statute, and amended it, taking the word \"presentment\" from its context in Ferber, where it was part of the definition of promotion, I thought that was the appendix. At least, that's my hypothetical question. And so whether you like appendices or don't like appendices, you could focus on why isn't it the appendix I'm talking about? He's filled it with qualifications using the words \"knowingly, reasonable,\" and a context that if it is not purely commercial, as I understood, is at least commercial plus a few things such as bartering. That was really my question, and you've come back to American Beauty and so forth, and if there's one thing I think his definition keeps out of this discussion, it is American Beauty and Traffic, because I don't see under his interpretation how anyone could conceivably be prosecuted even if he's talking to a group who have never seen a movie.

And if we accept that as a factual proposition, which was the Solicitor General's answer, and if we also accept, not by way of appendix but way of rationale in the opinion, that these various activities have got to be given an essentially commercial or quasi-commercial character, so that they don't pick up the conversations with the neighbor, then that's simply a matter of statutory interpretation that could be part of our rationale. If we accept the factual proposition about what reasonable viewers are likely to know, and we engage in that kind of interpretation following the Solicitor General's view of how this serial list of activities should be construed, don't we eliminate the possibility -- wouldn't we eliminate the possibility of substantial overbreadth?
