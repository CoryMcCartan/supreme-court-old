The judge said: I will not challenge her for cause. I counted another, juror -- what's this one -- juror number -- number’s 74, who when he looked her square in the eye and said, \"Can you be fair?\" She said, \"I can't say yes for sure. No.\" Okay? So, in my own subjective account, there were five here, maybe six, certainly three, that perhaps if they'd had an appeal on peremptories, which apparently they don't, they might have said these should have been challenged for cause. So I’m concerned about the 5 hours, about the lack of excusal for cause, about the very, very brief questions that he provided to people who had said on the questionnaire they could be -- they could be biased. They said we think he's guilty, for example. And all those are cause for concern. At the same time, I’m worried about controlling too much a trial judge. I’ve expressed those concerns. I know this is a special case. Half, almost, of the jury questionnaires they just threw out. And the community -- you know all the arguments there. You see what's worrying me.
