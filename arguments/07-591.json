How would that -- I don't understand how that would work."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"No. No. No. No, I'm saying that he would testify, I guess: I run the lab, these are the people I hire, they know you how to do these tests, and this guy did the test.

I think, Mr. Fisher, that was not quite responsive because the question here is whether or not there is an exception for business records. Nobody is talking about affidavits, witnesses, and so forth. We are talking about business records done in the ordinary course. It's true that it -- that the core principle is whether that confrontation is required, but the question is whether or not business records should be treated as something that are not testimony because they are done based on other protocols with other procedures where there is substantial insulation from the facts of the particular case because it's a routine scientific exercise. So I think your answer, I would agree, is responsive based on your theory of the case, but as a matter of practice and as a matter of the issue that's before the Court, I don't think it addresses it."},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":5,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Well, but the railroad case was an accident report.

I -- I think you're quite right that -- that, look, I can't find anything in the history that suggest lab reports would be admitted because they would be considered being prepared for trial. But business records are kept out. So we have here a source that's unlikely to be particularly biased, the University of Massachusetts labs. And we have the checks of the discipline, the scientific discipline. On the other hand, it's being prepared for this trial. So it seems to me some things go one way; some things go the other way. I don't know exactly what the predominant things are. That's what I'd like you to address as much as possible. And when I look at the definition of \"business records hearsay exception\" today, it seems to me that the \"hearsay exception\" does cover today some of the things under \"business records\" that would be prepared particularly for trial. You could have a company that goes and measures lines on the street, or tread marks, or a variety of things. And I guess they come in under the \"business records exception.\" Do they?

I'd -- I'd be quite interested in your views on what's a workable rule. And when I look across the country on this, it seems most States have worked with a rule that has allowed the defendant to call the witness if he wants. There is not a particular unfairness to that. If he can get ahold of the witness, no problem. But they said: We are not going to make the State do this because it's a waste of time, for the most part. It just delays the trial, and there is really nothing at issue."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":7,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"That's true."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":7,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"But if I assume -- I'm really uncertain as to whether it has covered \"testimonial\" or not.

The first thing you say is: Do you remember testing Mr. Diaz's sample? The guy is going to say no. Just as was pointed out, I, you know, test thousands of samples. Well, how long have you been working with the lab? You know, just what -- what was your scientific background? When did you -- how does this test work? You put three drops of the acid in there. It turns color, whatever it does. How do you know that? What is the chemical? I mean, you spend three hours with the guy until the jury just doesn't think there is anything to the case at all."},{"name":"JUSTICE ALITO","id":8,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"What does that fact support -- why does that fact support your argument, that in all of those cases you're arguing for what's going to be an empty exercise?"},{"name":"JUSTICE ALITO","id":8,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"No. But in -- in the instance where the defendant doesn't think it would be worthwhile to subpoena the -- the recordkeeper, the person who performed the test, but simply wants to put the prosecution through the effort of getting the person there to testify, it's -- what is achieved?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":7,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"I absolutely see that point. So that - all right, go back to the plea bargaining, which is your first thing, which makes me a little nervous for the reason that I see this bargaining system as a system where the prosecutor makes a charge, the prosecutor controls the sentence, then the defense bar would like to have an added weapon, and this added weapon is if you actually go to trial, I'm going to insist that you call these people. You don't even know where they are. I'm not going to accept the lab report. And then maybe the prosecutor will lower the requirement or maybe the prosecutor raised it in the first place because he thought you would say something like that. So I'm not -- is there anything you can say about how this works in the presence of plea bargaining? Do we know any -- do we have any information on that?"},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":5,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"I'm not sure it's one more witness.

Isn't that correct?"},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"How do we know that this was prepared in contemplation of litigation?

Why is it an exception?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":10,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Well, what about the -- the blue car going down the street statement? In a circumstantial evidence case the witness comes in and says yes, I saw a blue car go down the street at 10 o'clock. Is that testimonial?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":10,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"And the distinction between that and the lab report saying the substance that was shown to me which I analyzed was cocaine, what's the - - what's the distinction?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":4,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"I don't see the difference between the two. I mean, the one, he saw the blue car going down the street, which through other evidence can be connected to the defendant; and here the witness says this is cocaine, which through other evidence is going to be connected to the defendant. And in both cases that -- that connected fact is deemed essential by the prosecution for the conviction. I don't see the difference between the two."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":10,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Well, why - -"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":10,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Why does that make a difference? In other words, the -- Justice Scalia said a moment ago, you know, the -- the statement about the blue car is -- is tied in in the hypothetical case by another witness who said yes, at -- at 10:01 when I heard the gun go off there was a blue car there. In this case the cocaine is tied in by saying, yes, the cocaine which I delivered to X, about which he has testified, is cocaine that I took out of the pocket of the defendant. There is -- there is a temporal and physical path worked out in both cases. And it seems to me your attempt to distinguish them is to say well, the temporal path can be extended by one more step in the cocaine case because you can take the cocaine or take something from the cocaine sample and let the defense expert testify to it; which of course is true, but I don't see what that has got to do with the Confrontation Clause or the definition of testimonial evidence."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":10,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"But aren't you really saying that the confrontation right is therefore not so important because you have a greater opportunity in the cocaine case of coming up with -- with rebutting evidence, if indeed rebutting evidence can be found. In other words, if -- if -- if the State's witness is wrong, you've got a better shot at proving him wrong than in the blue car case. But if that is your argument, I don't see what it's got to do with - - with the basic confrontation right."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":10,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Well, have we ever had - - have we ever had a -- a kind of lab report, public record kind of case in -- in which the record was prepared expressly for trial?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":10,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Yes, but Justice Harlan did not take the majority view. I mean you -- I don't know where you get authority for the proposition that the public record prepared for the purpose of litigation would have come in under the, in effect, the founding era -- or would have been outside the founding era definition of testimonial."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":4,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"For the indictment, not - - not as -- not as independent evidence in the prosecution. It would form the basis for the indictment, as I understand what the history is. It would not be introduced and -- and -- and shown to the jury as evidence that -- that indeed the cause of death was thus and so."},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":5,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"It seems to me -- and tell me if this is not the way you want to argue. It seems to me to make your case you have to say of course this is hearsay; and the question is whether it's testimonial."},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":5,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"And it's not testimonial because these are laboratory protocols, subject to ongoing, objective, repeated standards; that's different from testimony that it was a blue car, which is specific to the case. That's the kind of framework of the argument you have to make."},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":5,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"And that as a result of that it is not testimonial because \"testimonial\" is a legal term that's subject to interpretation.

It wasn't testimonial because it wasn't really directed to trial.

And you concede that some interpretation of the machine-generated data ordinarily is required. Now why isn't that a suggestion that there is some leeway and subjective interpretation, and you might have different analysts coming out differently and so you need to get the fellow there and ask him well, how often do you -- how often do one of your fellow analysts disagree with your conclusion? Or this is subjective; I guess some people read it one way or the other one way; which way do you always read it? That kind of stuff."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Well, I didn't -- I didn't go back and read the scientific treatise you cite, but you say some interpretation is required. So what type of interpretation?"},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":5,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Well, do you have to have a machine? I mean, what about -- what about ballistics? \"This bullet came from that gun.\" Does that involve sufficient discretion, sufficient judgment that the expert has to be there, while the blood -- blood or drug testing doesn't? It seems to me that's where you have to draw the line."},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":5,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"And to say that that wasn't raised in the case, this is precisely the question we are going to have to decide if you're going to prevail.

His point I think is, look, you can't make any distinction either of something that is evidence was prepared with an eye towards trial or it wasn't. And if it was prepared with an eye towards trial, well, then call the person and have him testify. That's it. And if that encompasses every test under the sun, so be it, because there is no way to draw a reasonable line. You start talking about reliability and their amicus brief is filled with horror stories of how police labs or other labs have really been way off base and moreover really wrong.

How do we know?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":7,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"That's his point. No workable way to do it.
