They describe it at length.  The officer, the dog officer, said he was in a rush that day and it didn't take more than 5 to 10 minutes.  And my question really is whether an ordinary homeowner expects people to walk down the curtilage and, with a big animal, and the animal -- they don't knock.  They behave in the page 96, 97, 98 way.

That seems to me a proposition that's equally unacceptable to what the government is saying, that you have no interest in contraband.  The police often, when they have ordinary conversation with people, want to find out the details of what that person is doing, where the person lives, what goes on in the house. \"Hello, have you had a nice time at the -- at the park today?  I see you're coming home with your children; is this where you live?\"  This is all routine conversation that we always have in order to try to find out what people are doing, what they are like, where they live.  So I -- I think the statement, and you -- you repeated it quite accurately from what you have at page 16 of your brief -- just goes too far.
