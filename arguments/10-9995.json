Even if the party hasn't raised it, the court can raise it on this exact issue.  In Granberry, we said with respect to a different issue that the appellate court could raise it.  And, in Day, we said that those two issues were really the same. So, that seems sort of like a logical argument that just gets you to a place where you lose on the first question, unless perhaps there's a difference between a court raising a question sua sponte and a court allowing a party to raise it later than the party ought to have raised it.  Are you relying on that distinction, or are you questioning the logic of the basic argument that Granberry and Day decided this?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"I'm a little confused. You seem to be arguing that because the court of appeals raised it before the party did, that that's worse than a party raising it first.  Is that your position?

Now the court of appeals has more power?MS. LORD:  It raises different concerns.  My concern is not the relative power.  It's that when a court is raising something sua sponte, it defeats the party presentation principle.  That's one concern.

Now you're in the court of appeals.  What rule is there that addresses the situation in the court of appeals?"},{"name":"JUSTICE ALITO","id":7,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"You made an argument in your brief that I found a little difficult to follow, but --so, maybe you can explain it.  You seemed to suggest that the State's position on timeliness in the district court somehow induced your client to dismiss the claims that were arguably not exhausted.

I -- why -- you have two situations.  One situation, the State's raising timeliness.  So, he says, okay, they're raising timeliness; I'm not going to dismiss my -- the claims that they say are not exhausted.  The other situation, they -- they don't say anything about timeliness.  And he said now I'm going to dismiss the claims that are -- that they say are unexhausted. I don't understand the connection."},{"name":"JUSTICE ALITO","id":7,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Yes, I understand why that's a benefit to him, but what is the connection between that and the dismissal of the unexhausted claims?MS. LORD:  Oh.  Because if they had -- if they had challenged timeliness, they would have raised this very complicated issue, because the only way they can win on timeliness is to win on this newfangled notion of abandonment under Colorado law, which under Colorado law requires a hearing and requires factual development. And once they pursued in the district court that claim of abandonment, it was very likely that a lawyer would be appointed.  That lawyer could see that there were claims still pending in the 1995 motion and could possibly have sought a stay and abey, could have gone and tried to exhaust those claims, serious constitutional claims that were in the 1995 motion. And -- and maybe a better way of putting it is if they had raised timeliness in the district court, abandonment would have been front and center.  And even though the court of appeals ultimately resolved this issue without an evidentiary hearing, that was an abuse of discretion itself, too.  It was totally contrary to Colorado law, analyzing that issue. It is no small thing that the position that they took in the district court allowed Mr. Wood to go forward on two claims, two constitutional claims that are substantial that the court has granted a certificateof appealability on. This is -- this case is so unlike Day in the sense -- if an appellate court can raise sua sponte the statute of limitations in a case like this, it can raise it in any case.  It invites the State to take a position in the district court which would be totally contrary to AEDPA's desire for streamlined proceedings.

Now, I did look at Black's Law Dictionary, and Black's Law Dictionary, looking up forfeiture and waiver, it seems like you lose. My analysis would be this:  Forfeiture is the \"loss of a right\" -- that's what's at issue -- \"because of a crime.\"  That doesn't apply.  \"Because of a breach of obligation.\"  That doesn't apply.  \"Neglect of duty.\"  Now, that does because you didn't file the answer.  Okay?  So, that's forfeited. Now you look over to waiver and, as you say, it says \"voluntary relinquishment of a legal right.\" Okay, what's the legal right?  The legal right is to get the case dismissed. So, I'm the judge.  I say, State, do you want to get the case dismissed?  I just gave youranswer.  Okay.  I say you voluntarily relinquish your legal right.  Your legal right was to get the case dismissed, and you relinquished it.  You didn't assert it. That said, that would be the difference. And she's saying that.  She's saying that makes a lot of sense.  When you read Day, they're worried about the State doing something inadvertently, making a mistake. So, what the judge says is:  State, you know you have a pretty good claim here on statute of limitations, but you didn't assert it.  So, I'm going to give you the right to assert it.  Go ahead, assert it even though it's late.  You overcome the forfeiture. Now you say:  I assert it, Your Honor. Okay, you haven't waived it.

He didn't abandon the right to get the case dismissed if the judge pursues it. So, your colleague says -- or as she says, a court of appeals does have the power on its own to overcome a forfeiture.  That's Day.  But they don't have the power on its own to overcome the waiver.  And that's what they're doing.  They don't have the power, in other words, to decide it themselves.

So, you put the district court to the necessity of deciding thecase on the merits.  It does.  It takes up the two unexhausted claims and deals with them on the merits. In -- in Day, absolutely nothing transpired between the State saying the claim was timely and the magistrate's detection of the computation error.  The district court wasn't put to what was unnecessary work. If the -- it was the consequence of saying we won't challenge it that forced the district judge to deal with them on the merits. In Day, the counsel didn't bring up the question because counsel thought that it was timely.  He had miscalculated and made a mathematical error.  And the judge then said, you know, I see that the number of days that's required by statute, they have run.  And as Day pointed out, at that point, the trial judge could have said:  Now, you know, you miscalculated; wouldn't you like to amend your complaint and put it in a defense?

ARBUS SHERRY:  No, that's certainly true.  I think the procedural default cases are another good example.  This Court in Day cited a number of them, a number of them of which were cases in which the court of appeals was raising the issue sua sponte. On page 12 of our brief, we cite a number of procedural default cases.  A lot of them come up in the sua sponte context.  And the courts of appeals have not made a distinction between the two. I think they certainly implicate different concerns.  For example, to the extent this Court has been worried about sandbagging or strategic behavior, I think that's largely absent in circumstances where the court is raising it on its own motions as opposed to the party belatedly raising the issue on appeal. So, I do think if you look at Granberry, you look at Day, you look at Caspari, you look at Schiro, and you look at the procedural default cases, I think that really does resolve the first question presented.
