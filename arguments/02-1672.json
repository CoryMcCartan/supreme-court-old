It's a very clear opinion in my view. Very clear. And the key language I thought is, the language statutes that focus on the person regulated rather than individuals protected create no implication of an intent to confer the private right. So they're looking at disparate impact and disparate impact, according to the majority -- I was in the dissent -- did not intend to protect the person discriminated against, but was a way of regulating people so they wouldn't intentionally discriminate. I can understand that. But I apply the same -- I didn't agree with it, but I can understand it. The -- the -- I apply the same reasoning here. The reasoning here is that this retaliation thing is not trying to protect university behavior one whit more than the whole underlying thing is trying to protect university behavior. This is about victims. Retaliation and being fired is about victims. And so given Sandoval, then we have the history, we have the language, and we have that sentence from Sandoval. And all that suggests -- it goes into 1681(a), in which case Sandoval says, a private right of action, given Cannon, would be inferred.
