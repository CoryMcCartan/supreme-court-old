It's somebody else's, you know, DNA and that's what's necessary for the conviction. And there's others -- other types of DNA evidence that doesn't.

And that may be a true and correct criticism, but whether it is or not, he has agreed, indeed, nine members or seven members or something of the Court agreed, that the test I read to you is the test. And now, if that's the test, getting the DNA does not necessarily spell speedier release; it all depends on what the -- on what that DNA shows.  So why isn't that end of the matter?"},{"name":"JUSTICE KAGAN","id":6,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Mr. Coleman, if you could answer Justice Breyer's question, because there are two phrases, \"necessarily imply the invalidity of the conviction\" and \"necessarily spell speedier release\"; and either you think that your case fits one of those or both of those standards, or you are asking us to abandon that standard."},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":4,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Filed in the -- in the court of conviction?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":9,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"So that's a totally different area, because in Dotson when -- I think what we did do was go through every of these -- every one of the prior cases, and they did involve for the most part the attack, as you say, on prison procedure.  And those cases where the attack on the proceeding would have restored good-time credits, there it was shortening the -- the length of confinement. In those cases where there was a general attack on procedures, but the procedure would simply be carried on better later, like parole, there wasn't.  You suddenly focused me on a whole new set of areas.  Where in the case law is this different rule that the rule we just said has nothing to do with it, if it's in the case?  That's basically what you are arguing.  What should I read to show that you were right on that?"},{"name":"JUSTICE KAGAN","id":6,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"But how could this be brought in habeas?

And we have the Dotson point, and you said there are two other cases, Preiser and Heck.  So what Dotson says about Preiser is that the plaintiff there wanted the shortening of his term of confinement.  He wanted good-time credits to be restored.  And as we read it then, the shortening of the term of confinement is what made it proper in habeas.  But we added that if it hadn't been for that, if it hadn't attacked the duration of the physical confinement, it wouldn't be habeas; it would be 1983. In Heck, the same thing.  They were establishing the basis for a damages claim that necessarily demonstrated the invalidity of the conviction.  Where that was so, there would be habeas. Where that was not so, even if successful, it would not demonstrate the invalidity of any outstanding criminal judgment, the action should be allowed to proceed in 1983.  So as we read those two cases, they stood for the exact principle I described. Now, you want, perfectly fairly, to say: But we didn't read them correctly, or we shouldn't have  read them as exclusively to say what I've just read. Fine. What is it, in your opinion, precisely, that we should have the principle of distinguishing the one 1983 from habeas corpus if we were to abandon as an exclusive test what we said, and I just read you in those three cases:  Dotson, Preiser, Heck?  What's your contrary approach?"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":3,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Then you are -- you are asking for a modification of the Wilkinson-Dotson formula, because the formula is, I think, quite clear. It says:  \"Would necessarily demonstrate the invalidity of the conviction or the sentence.\"  Wouldn't necessarily demonstrate, and the Petitioner is telling us, it may not demonstrate it at all.  It may demonstrate that my client was, in fact, guilty.  So it wouldn't necessarily demonstrate the invalidity of the conviction. And I think to get -- to get -- to say that you should prevail, you would have to say:  Court, you  were wrong in using that formula, because here we have a petitioner who says, I'm not claiming that what I'm seeking would demonstrate the invalidity of the conviction."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":3,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"So you are asking for something in addition.  You say:  Court, don't just look at the words in Wilkinson v. Dotson.  This is a different case, as I suggested originally.  This does not involve parole.  The ultimate destination in this case is the conviction and sentence."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":8,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Maybe -- maybe we need -- I mean, we've never had a case like this, and it's conceivable to -- to me that we have to expand what we said in Heck and Preiser.  I'm not sure, however, that what we ought to say is what you propose:  That the test is whether it could be brought in habeas.  You say it could be brought in habeas by claiming ineffective assistance of counsel, but you would lose that -- that habeas. You can bring anything in habeas.  I mean, you can file a habeas petition.  I assume you mean you could possibly win in habeas.  You couldn't win in habeas with this claim because you couldn't show that it  would have affected the outcome.  Isn't that so?"},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":4,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Well -- well, that doesn't quite give us the added formulation that some of the questions suggest we need, if we're going to adhere to Dotson and still rule for you.  There has to be some slightly different qualification.  I'm not quite sure what it is."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":9,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"But if -- in Heck itself, we said a 1983 action, where it is -- even if successful, will not demonstrate the invalidity of any outstanding criminal judgment, a 1983 action should be allowed to proceed.
