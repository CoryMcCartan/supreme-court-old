And they cite reports, and -- you know, it's classic to have contractors sit in as arbitrators in construction claims; just because it's cheaper and they know -- so I was thinking that that's substantial justification for your position.

Essentially, the claim here, right, is that this is a party with a monopolistic power, such that -- and this is just the Plaintiff's allegation, it may or may not be true, but -- but they say that American Express is using its market power to impose particular contract terms. And they have a tying thing, but it could just as easily be the case that American Express could be using its economic power to impose terms essentially making arbitration of antitrust claims impossible. And why shouldn't we understand this problem as connected to the very allegation that's being brought?  That -- you know, how is it, how is it going to be possible in a case where there's a monopoly power able -- able to impose contracts terms that -- that you can create an arbitration clause, which essentially prevents that from being challenged?"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Did -- did American Express say, as Justice Breyer suggested, that, well we will concede A, B, and C, so the only issue on which you need proof is D?

I'm asking whether American Express -- so here's the complaint.  It says, I have to prove relevant markets separately.  And did American Express take the position, no, you don't have to prove all that.  I think that's what Justice Breyer was suggesting.  There's only one thing that's really in controversy, and the rest we could stipulate. But I didn't see anything in all the time this case has been in the courts on American Express's part to say that we are not going to demand the full breadth of proof."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":6,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"I suppose that American Express wouldn't have had to agree to arbitration at all, right?

They could say that, legally, couldn't they?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":6,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"And until Rule 23 was adopted, that would mean -- you know, if you had a small claim, tough luck, right?

Tell me exactly what your position is on that."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Well, it seems to me -- I don't see how that concession is at all needed by the other side.  I mean, let's just say they have a trade association or something.  They -- they can all get together and say we want to prepare an antitrust expert report about what American Express is doing, and they do, and then presumably, one of them can use it in the arbitration.

"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":6,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"I don't see -- I don't see how a Federal statute is frustrated or is unable to be vindicated if it's too expensive to bring a Federal suit.  That happened for years before there was such a thing as class action in Federal courts.  Nobody thought the Sherman Act was a dead letter, that it couldn't be vindicated."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":6,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"And I don't see why it's any different when you transpose the situation to the -- to the arbitration situation."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":9,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Before you get to that, I have two questions.  One is on the point you've just made because I -- I agree, I understand it is fairly well established, this doctrine, but I don't see quite how it works. Suppose there's a Tyler claim, a Truth in Lending Act -- you know, something like that, and the claim is a fairly -- it's worth about $10,000 or so. And so the plaintiff says you violated the act, pay me the $10,000.  Now, he happens to come up with a theory that is really far out; and the more far out the theory, the harder it is to prove.  And the harder it is to prove, the more you need expensive experts. And do we go case by case, saying -- you know, where you have a really weird theory that's going to require 17 experts and endless studies, you don't have to have an arbitration claim, or you don't have to follow it in this instance, but everybody else does. Now -- now, is -- is that something, in other words, we're supposed to look at case by case, which would produce the odd result I suggested?  Or do we do it by categories?  How does the doctrine work?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":9,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"No, what I'll do because I work with my own hypothetical, I'll have a far-out case, but yet not quite speculative.  In other words, what I'm trying to suggest is it's an odd doctrine that just says, plaintiff by plaintiff, you can ignore an arbitration clause if you can get a case that's expensive enough, and there we are. I haven't seen it work, and I haven't seen enough to know how it does work.  And I guess you haven't either, but -- but I'm concerned about that."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":9,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Well, that doesn't seem right to me.  Now, Hovenkamp would be the person I would hire as the arbitrator.  So surely he does know -- or Phil Arita -- a blessed memory.  And they're under the instruction to get this done cheap.  Well, I think that might be possible. That might be possible because it's only the question of damages that's tough here because if you don't have the double -- there's only one monopoly profit at the two levels, da, da, da, and we don't need to go through that. But I can think of a way of getting it done pretty cheap.  But regardless, your expert here didn't talk about the cost of arbitration.  He did use the word once.  But as I read pages 88 through 92, it seemed to me he was talking about the cost of litigation, not the cost of arbitration.  And -- and I wouldn't proceed necessarily with all those reports he does to impress to the jury, or even the judge. This is Phil Arita.  You don't need to impress him.  And -- so, so, so -- hasn't the Second Circuit looked, assuming your doctrine's in place, to the wrong set of costs:  The cost of litigation?  Even though they use the word \"arbitration,\" that isn't what your expert told me."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":9,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"In arbitration or in court?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":9,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Does he take into account the fact that the arbitrator can be him?  And moreover, could, in fact, work under an instruction keep these costs down?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":9,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"No, that isn't the point. If I were doing this offhand, I would say everything is conceded, but for one thing:  Since there is no double monopoly power, there is only one monopoly power at the two levels which can be exercised, the only way the person is damaged is if in fact you've raised entry barriers.  So you'd say to the plaintiff, how are you going to prove that?  And you'd read it and submit a report. Now, I'm not saying this is the right way to go about it.  All I'm saying is it's hard for me to figure out on the basis of that affidavit, which talks about courts, why this has to be so expensive.  So what do I do?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":9,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"One other thing which I didn't understand, and that's why I am asking.  What they chose as the remedy here was sever the arbitration clause if you want, it seemed to be, and go to court. All right. Now, I don't know where that power comes from.  So if you were going to improve this contract in the direction that you would like, why couldn't you sever the part about the confidentiality, or why couldn't you require -- you have some awfully big merchants. Like, I don't know -- probably, you have maybe Costco, maybe Walmart, maybe -- you know, these people are not without money.  Though your client, may be.  But -- go get these contributions.  Go for -- there are many ways you can treat this particular set of words in the arbitration clause, short of severing it entirely. And -- and what about that?  What's your view on that?  What do you think?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":6,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"You -- you -- I don't understand.  You think they could have appealed on that -- on that issue?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":6,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Let me ask you.

I don't understand that."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":6,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Or in court."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":6,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"You have to compare it to court."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":6,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"If you couldn't do it in court, you don't have to be able to do it in arbitration, it seems to me."},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":8,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"No.  No.  It's saying that there's an alternate mechanism for resolving disputes. It's called arbitration.  And arbitration does not necessarily or even as a matter of fact often as a practical matter involve the costs and the formalities of litigation."},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":8,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Well, I mean maybe it is litigation if you need a $300,000 report.  But why do you need a $300,000 report?  That's what we're asking. And I just can't -- it seems to me that I have to engage in speculation about the limits of arbitration in order to resolve in your favor. Now, to be sure, they took a -- a more rigid view below, so we don't have much of a record."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"It's a little much to expect them to come back and say, oh no, no, no, you don't have to prove all this.  The only thing you've got to prove is it's going to cost you $25,000.  That's an odd position to put them in."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":9,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"There is no authority that I could find for the prop -- I mean, if in fact it costs you $10,000 to buy the arbitrator -- system -- you know, you buy the system -- (Laughter.)"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":9,"spokeBefore":9,"sideBefore":"justices","text":"Sorry.  But I mean -- you know, hire -- whatever it is, if those are obstacles, it's pretty well established, I think, that that arbitration is not something that you can use to vindicate the Federal claim.  And the part that's bothering me about this, though, is that those aren't obstacles. It's just you brought a very expensive claim.  And the real problem here is the reason they can go into court is they can get a class action in court. And then this Court has said, you can't get the class action in arbitration.  There we have it. So -- so the -- the question in my mind is, well, is there a way that some of the beneficial aspects of class action can be used in an arbitration that does not formally have a class action?  And there it seems yours is a good case because a lot of them can.  You say, well, the one part that can't is getting this private information. So maybe we should send it back and say, well, why do you need the private information?  On a good theory of antitrust, you're going to show that the price of the Tide product was higher than what it would have been had the entry barriers not been raised from the Tide.  That's a general entry question, which I don't think you need private information from them to answer.  But that's -- and now we're really into the depths of the merits. So I thought of sending it back and saying, let's -- let them explore this kind of thing about other ways of trying to get some of these advantages of class action into your -- you're going to say I'm too far out on this."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":6,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"They could write a treatise on it, maybe."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":6,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Suppose this class could not -- could not qualify for certification in Federal court.

Now, once that's adopted, it seems to me in practice we have reversed in many, many cases the proposition that you can, in fact, require Federal causes of action to be arbitrated because all you have to do to get -- out of the arbitration is to allege a theory of your case which is hard and complicated to prove.  Now, you are back in court. Now, that's a significant erosion, it seems to me.  So I want to know if you have any standard there, if we're just supposed to accept that, if in fact you are trying to reverse in practice what was the holding that you can arbitrate these Federal causes of action.  What is going on here? And an addendum to that is if you are going to convince me, which you might, that, well, that's okay, do it, do it, do it, is it a possible remedy to monkey with the arbitration clause and provide for a sharing of costs, say if you win, the loser will pay the expert fees, which is of course a much more pro-arbitration way than just throwing it out entirely?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":9,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"That's a long question, but do you see what I'm driving at?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":6,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Excuse me.
