I thought venue was something that Congress determined."},{"name":"JUSTICE ALITO","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"In the Stewart case to which you just referred, the court said, \"The parties do not dispute that the district court properly denied the motion to dismiss the case for improper venue under 1406(a)\" because Respondent apparently does business in the Northern District of Alabama, which was not the Alderson Reporting Company jurisdiction specified in the forum selection clause. So what -- if we were to write an opinion in your favor, what would you suggest we say about that?"},{"name":"JUSTICE ALITO","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Well, that's -- that's true, but it means that the entire discussion in Stewart is beside the point.  The Court wrote a decision about an issue that really never should arise because the party seeking -- as you see it, the party seeking to enforce the forum selection clause should proceed under 1406. Alderson Reporting Company So Stewart said, well, if -- if you proceed under the wrong provision, this is how it should come out.  It makes the whole decision essentially meaningless, doesn't it?"},{"name":"JUSTICE ALITO","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"I don't see how that would -- I don't see how that would work.  You're -- this is the argument you made in your reply brief, that if this -- if the case had been filed in the jurisdiction specified in the forum selection clause, that court could nevertheless proceed under 1404(a) and Alderson Reporting Company transfer it back to the Western District of Texas, for example.  That's -- that's your argument, right?"},{"name":"JUSTICE ALITO","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"In exceptional cases.  But 1404(a) says that it can -- a case can be transferred to a district where it might have been brought.

So if I'm looking at that, I'm thinking, well, those rules apply.  And they can't be reversed or countermanded or whatever by -- by contract, by parties' agreement, except to the extent that the contract can figure centrally into the 1404 analysis.

Here is venue."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":6,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"That's only -- what that tells us is that venue is a highly waiverable thing. You can stand on your venue right, but you don't have to. My problem with your interpretation is you are allowing a private agreement to make a venue prescription that Congress enacted improper.  Congress said it was proper.  It may be that it should not apply in this case because the parties have consented to something else, but it's not a wrong venue. I mean, suppose the question had never come up.  The -- there wasn't a claim that this was a wrong venue.  The -- the case could have proceeded, and it would have been a place of proper venue, right?

Both 1404(a) and 1406 provide for transfer.  This Court has emphasized that it's one Federal system, and within the Federal system, the result shouldn't be dismissed, bring the case all over again, pay a new filing fee; instead of that, just transfer to the appropriate forum.  And that's what Professor Sachs' view leaves out because the result, as you say, is -- it's only dismissal, no transfer."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":7,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Excuse me.

The 12(b)(6) is something -- it's an on-the-merits determination about the viability of your claim.  It has res judicata effect, whereas this is not.  This is just a question of, did you bring the thing in the right place and you should be allowed to bring it someplace else."},{"name":"JUSTICE KAGAN","id":5,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"No, I know the courts have been.

It seems -- because I start out for reasons I won't go into thinking, well, perhaps it doesn't matter, frankly; you can get to the same result under any one of these three approaches. But then one thing Professor Sachs says does bother me, that if we take your approach, then how do we deal with the problem of removal?  I mean, you can only remove a case to a court which is in the district where the person -- the plaintiff filed.  Now, if there is a forum selection clause, the defendant seems to me to be stuck, because he can't go to a -- he can't go to a -- Alderson Reporting Company to another. He can't go to another court.        He can't go to the court within the district because of the forum selection clause, and he can't go into another court because of 1441(a).

But if it makes not much difference, I have three routes that seem to me all should work out the same way, and in favor of their route is the absolute language that Justice Kagan pointed out before, plus the footnote.  Okay? So I'm thinking, hey, this doesn't make -- it's important to have a rule.  It's important to have one clear approach.  But as between the three, it shouldn't matter, and they should all reach the same conclusions.  So let's go with the language of Stewart. Alderson Reporting Company All right.

Let's suppose you're right about 1404, and I think you have some pretty good arguments. 1404, it seems to me, shouldn't affect this case in the sense that you should have -- this was a negotiated contract. You got something for the fact that you accepted inconvenience when you brought a suit.  And under 1404, the court is perfectly entitled -- the court has to take that into account, that this was a negotiated contract, that you accepted in convenience, and that you got something for your -- for your acceptance of inconvenience.  The end.  You have to live with your contract."},{"name":"JUSTICE ALITO","id":4,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Well, the interests -- the interests of justice that the district court weighed almost all boiled down to the interests of your client, the inconvenience of witnesses.  Well, Atlantic Marine, to the extent we're talking about their witnesses, they're not concerned about the inconvenience of having their witnesses go to -- to Norfolk, but your witnesses -- the other witnesses are your witnesses.  So that's a factor that goes to your convenience. Compulsory process to produce witnesses, same thing.

I mean, maybe the jury has to take 42 visits to the bottom of an oil well shaft.  I don't know.  I mean, there could be something that would weigh in your favor. I don't know the case.  So why not go to Virginia and then file a 1404 motion? And it should reach the same result, whether Alderson Reporting Company you -- you go to Texas and ask to stay there or whether you go to Virginia under 1404(a) -- you win this case, let's say -- or whether you go to Virginia.

They aren't barring you from that on their view. But my thought is that, if all these come to the same result in the end and you just need one ruling, we have something pointing on their side -- your side, which is the Stewart footnote and the language of the -- you know, the absolute language of the venue statutes, and you have something pointing in their side, which is, if we count by numbers, five circuits are in their favor and only three in yours.

It gives a broad discretion.  It says they may transfer. 1406 is an entirely different animal.        It says you shall dismiss or -- or transfer.

The only thing that could weigh in the balance against that is if there is some -- something that has nothing to do with your convenience, but is instead a feature of -- of -- something about why it's important to the judicial system, to the public interest, about keeping the trial in one place.
