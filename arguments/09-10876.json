Jason sees the B and goes into court -- you make him go into court; that's our case. And what I wonder is, is the defendant now entitled to the following instruction: Jury, because he's in court, he can say that the machine read B, but that proves nothing about the vial, nothing. All it proves is what someone said in the laboratory to another person, and those two people aren't in court. Now, that's -- you see, that's the problem, I think, of the intermediate step.

The analyst is beginning to testify about standard lab procedures, and then defense attorney says, \"Your Honor, I'm going to object to what's done in the status quo.\" I take that to mean what is generally done. \"I don't object to what was done in this case.\" So the defense attorney is preventing -- is objecting to the prosecution's attempting to discharge its responsibility with respect to those first three propositions through testimony about standard procedures, and is insisting that the analyst provide the testimony that you say was a violation of the Confrontation Clause; namely, testifying as to what was done in this particular case."},{"name":"JUSTICE ALITO","id":6,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"But if the -- if the machine had expelled a piece of paper that said .21, that piece of paper would not be a -- introduction of that piece of paper, the contents of the piece of paper, would not be a violation of the Confrontation Clause?"},{"name":"JUSTICE ALITO","id":6,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Well, how can -- how can you debate it?
