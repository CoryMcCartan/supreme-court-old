If the instruction had said that, you would have a very different instruction, and I'm bothered by the instruction too for just that reason. It says you may consider, and if I were a juror parsing the instruction, I would say, \"why? You've just told me I'm not supposed to punish them.\""},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":4,"text":"Okay. This is an argument you're making to us, but I don't know how a juror is supposed to figure this out."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":3,"text":"Where did the Oregon Supreme Court say it was proper to punish for harm to nonparties? Your brief quotes something to that effect, but -- the sentence on page 18(a) of the appendix to the petition. It says, what the Oregon court said is, Philip Morris asserts that Campbell prohibits the State acting through a civil jury from using punitive damages to punish a defendant for harm to nonparties. The Oregon Supreme Court on its own, I think, didn't put it in terms of harming particular nonparties, but to exposing Oregon residents to the risk of a deadly disease."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":4,"text":"Let me -- let me -- let me focus the problem that I have right now this way. If I look at the Oregon Supreme Court opinion, and particularly at the point that you mention in 20 and 21, I have to say I, I read the opinion the way you read the opinion. I read them the same, just what you claimed they were saying. The difficulty that I have is because I think the instruction that was proposed on behalf of your client was not a clear instruction, I have great difficulty in seeing how I could find that it was error to refuse to give the instruction."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":4,"text":"So my problem is, if I think they really did have the wrong view of the law but the issue was focused at the trial court by a request for an instruction which I think was properly denied, what do I do? Do I concentrate on what they said in the opinion or do I concentrate on what I think was the deficiency of the instruction?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":4,"text":"But then they would respond, when they made that, when they gave that explanation in the Oregon Supreme Court, they were responding to a claim of error which was focused and raised at the trial level by the request for an instruction, which strikes me as probably an unsound instruction, an unsound request."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":5,"text":"Well, I guess we could leave it up to them whether they want to disallow the instruction for a different reason, but the fact is they disallowed it for the reason that you say."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":5,"text":"And we can say that is error and remand it to them. That might not make you very happy, but it would be up to them whether or not"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":4,"text":"In effect, it would give you another chance in Oregon."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":4,"text":"It was a good thing we weren't instructing a jury."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":4,"text":"Oh, I do too. I don't have any trouble with the distinction."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":4,"text":"But it doesn't answer the question, if the juror were to speak up. It doesn't answer the question. Consider for what? How? Why am I supposed to be considering it when you've just told me not to punish?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":4,"text":"Or not punish for other - -"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":5,"text":"No. If it had said that, I would have no trouble with it. What it says is, you may consider it in determining what the reasonable relationship is between the harm caused to Jesse Williams and the amount of punitive damages assessed. I don't see how injury to others can have any bearing upon whether the punitive damages bear a reasonable relationship to Jesse Williams' harm. That's my problem with it."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":5,"text":"I don't."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"text":"And when you do that, counsel, aren't you punishing the defendant for the harm to others? You're going to award a higher multiple with respect to the damages - -"},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"text":"-- based on the conduct to others. Why wouldn't a normal juror think - -"},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"text":"Excuse me. Why wouldn't a normal jury view that as punishing the defendant for the harm to others?"},{"name":"JUSTICE STEVENS","id":6,"text":"But, Mr. Frey, let me ask you a question. Suppose this was a criminal case and the defendant was being punished for crime A and the judge in working out the sentence realizes he also committed crimes B, C, D, and E. He could take those into account in determining the extent of the sentence given for crime A. Why isn't that similar?"},{"name":"JUSTICE STEVENS","id":6,"text":"And if there was a second -- the same defendant got convicted again for crime X. At that sentencing the judge could again take into account the harm to defendants B, C, and D."},{"name":"JUSTICE STEVENS","id":6,"text":"That's not the same harm if it's a different defendant or a different plaintiff in the second case. You're punishing him for the harm to be this time, and you can -- just as in a criminal case, why can't you in both cases take into account that, the harm to the class, to the public at large?"},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":7,"text":"In that respect, how does the -- there may not be a definitive authority by this. Oregon says that if a corporation commits manslaughter it's required to pay up to twice the amount the corporation gained by committing the offense - -"},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":7,"text":"-- is my understanding. Suppose a corporation in a hypothetical case commits five manslaughters. Would they be liable -- and gained for $1 million. Would they be liable for twice a million dollars in every manslaughter case?"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":3,"text":"But Mr. Frey, we don't know what Oregon law is on that point. They do have a law that the Oregon court thought meant that they must adjust in the next case. And how would you deal - - would it be different if Oregon, as many States, said part of that punitive award goes not to the plaintiff, but to some State fund?"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":3,"text":"But if the law in Oregon were, plaintiff number two, you don't get punitive damages or you can get only the difference between what the jury awarded you and what Philip Morris has already paid out in punitive damages?"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":3,"text":"We don't know what it is. We haven't had the second case."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":8,"text":"Can I ask you -- are you finished?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":8,"text":"I wanted to know what you think about a suggestion that I got from something that Justice Scalia said. I don't know whether he was making it or not, but I'll make the suggestion and see what you think. Suppose that this case -- suppose we were to say, there are many issues in this case, some of them very difficult, but one thing we're certain about: You cannot in a trial consistent with the due process clause in a trial of plaintiff versus defendant take money from the defendant and give it to the plaintiff for the purpose of punishing the Defendant for something he did to a different person who wasn't there. Now -- so he couldn't defend against him. That person didn't present a claim. So we are certain of that. Now, we're not certain whether that's what happened here. It may have done. There is certainly a lot of language to suggest it, and there is some language the other way. So we remand it to the court with that instruction that they cannot permit this to have happened if it happened. Whether it happened and what happened is a matter of Oregon law in large part and things about instructions, etc. Now, what's your view of that kind of disposition?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":8,"text":"Maybe, but it's possible the Oregon court would say: Well, no instructions are perfect, but -- and no set of jury instructions is perfect. But if we look at the jury instructions without the suggested one that was rejected and then we look at the suggested one, we find the suggested one had many things wrong with it, not just, you know, problems, confusion, et cetera. We find the instructions weren't perfect but, given Oregon evidentiary law, we think the trial judge made reasonable decisions, therefore okay."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":8,"text":"I don't know. That's what worrying me, what's worrying me about this is I see as we try to determine what this instruction said, whether it was good enough, whether the instructions without it are good enough, that we're going to be in a kind of bog of mixtures of constitutional law, unclear Oregon State law, not certain exactly what was meant by whom in the context of the trial, et cetera."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"text":"Mr. Frey, I suppose your theory here depends on the nature of the underlying tort, I suppose, in that there are, you argue, defenses that might be available with respect to other, other individuals who are harmed."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"text":"So this argument wouldn't apply in a case if the underlying tort weren't susceptible to those sorts of defenses."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":5,"text":"The jury can't really find that other people were harmed. The jury doesn't have evidence before it except as to this person. The most the jury can find, it seems to me, is that the, the activity engaged in bore a very serious risk of harming other people. I think a jury could find that. And therefore, the activity is more heinous and should be punished more severely. But I -- you don't - -"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":5,"text":"Yes, but I don't think I'm quibbling, but you seem to be conceding that this jury can decide that other people have been harmed and take into account the harm that it found other people suffered in deciding the penalty. And I don't think this jury has any basis for finding that other people were harmed. It could say there was a serious risk of it."},{"name":"JUSTICE STEVENS","id":6,"text":"Isn't there a distinction between actual harm to others and the risk of harm? Supposing a defendant fired a machine gun into a crowd of people."},{"name":"JUSTICE STEVENS","id":6,"text":"And he killed one, at least one. And that one sued and said: I want extra punitive damages because all these other people were subjected to the same risk. Wouldn't that be a proper consideration?"},{"name":"JUSTICE STEVENS","id":6,"text":"Would it be a proper consideration even if a second person brought the same action?"},{"name":"JUSTICE STEVENS","id":6,"text":"But you're not asking to recover for the actual harm to the others. You're saying there was a general risk of harm to many, many people, which is similar to what we have here. We don't know whether they're harmed or not, but that can be taken into account in fixing the ultimate verdict."},{"name":"JUSTICE STEVENS","id":6,"text":"Isn't the time to determine what to do with the second lawsuit is when the second lawsuit is brought?"},{"name":"JUSTICE STEVENS","id":6,"text":"But can't I punish for the risk of harm to B, C, and D?"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":3,"text":"But part of this award, at least according to the trial -- there's a footnote referring to an Oregon statute that provides for the distribution of punitive damages between prevailing parties and the State of Oregon. Is -- was this award shared?"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":3,"text":"But would it be?"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":3,"text":"But if the State law provides that part of the recovery goes to the State, then at least as to the part that goes to the State you can say, well the State has recovered and you can't - -"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":3,"text":"But then you can object in the next case if you're subjected to - -"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":3,"text":"No, I mean when you lose the case on the merits and there's a determination of damages, Oregon says, we adjust for having a prior award. We don't know what that adjustment will be."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"text":"Thank you, Mr. Frey. Mr. Peck. "},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":5,"text":"You're losing me, counsel. What, what specifically is wrong with the instruction proposed here?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":5,"text":"As briefly as possible, one, two, three."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"text":"-- you object to in this instruction. I mean, and I thought our cases clearly established that you can consider the harm to others in assessing the reprehensible nature of the conduct. You don't disagree with that?"},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"text":"On the other hand, you cannot -- on the other hand you cannot punish the defendant for those harms particularly in a case where the defendant might have defenses available with respect to those others. So I understood what the instruction sought to do is simply try to draw, it's a fine line but the reason it's a fine line is because of our prior cases, and it tried to draw that distinction between assessing reprehensibility and punishing for harm to others."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":5,"text":"Would it have been a proper instruction if the second sentence had read, although you may consider the extent of harm suffered by others in determining what the -- what that reasonable relationship is, although you may consider the extent of harm suffered by others in determining how heinous the crime, the action of the defendant was, and hence - - what, what that reasonable relationship is? If you had just added in that additional thought."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":5,"text":"It seems to me that's all that's left out of it. Now does leaving that out of it make it erroneous?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":5,"text":"Yes but reprehensibility analysis is part of the reasonable relationship. The more reprehensible it is the higher the ratio can be, according to our cases as I understand it."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":5,"text":"You're saying this instruction was too favorable to you - -"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":5,"text":"-- because it allowed them to consider harm."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":5,"text":"And you don't think they should have been allowed to consider harm, correct?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":8,"text":"Why, why -- why though? I'm having the same problem. As I read the sentence that we have just been quoted it seems to me at first blush that it's completely right. You may consider the harm, the extent of harm suffered by others in determining what the reasonable relationship is. Now you have to be sophisticated in this. Don't ask me how the jury is, but assuming that they are, that means that the more severely awful the conduct, the higher the ratio between the damage award and the injury suffered by this victim in court. And if it's really bad, you're going to maybe have a hundred times this compensation instead of only ten times or five times. So -- we take it into account, the extent of the harm that could be suffered, in deciding what that ratio should be. That means it goes to the evilness of the conduct. But you are not to punish the defendant for the impact of its alleged misconduct on other persons who aren't here in court. In other words, what you aren't to do is to look at good old Mrs. Smith who has really suffered terribly, she happens not to be in court, think about her suffering, which is real and serious, and then say I'm going to punish this defendant because of what he did to her. Which would be a natural human reaction, and perhaps admirable, but regardless, the law is that that's what you're not supposed to do. So reading it as I just read it naturally, it seems to describe what our cases have said is the law. Why isn't that right? I'm looking for a real answer to the question. I'm posing it in a hostile way and hope I'll get an answer. [Laughter.]"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":8,"text":"I - -"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":8,"text":"Yes."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"text":"Well, because the instructions indicate and juries often do this that punitive damages are certain multiple of the compensatory damages, and therefore that's what they are saying. In determining what that multiple should be you consider whether they have harmed others. And this instruction would make all the difference to the world in terms of what lawyers are going to be arguing about. If you're allowed to punish for harm to others, you say, well, there is however many, a thousand other people in the plaintiff's position, so a thousand times would be perfectly reasonable but you wouldn't say that the conduct is a thousand times more reprehensible. There is a more, there is a more natural limit on the multiple when you get this kind of instruction."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":5,"text":"Counsel, it seems to me the point you're making is not the basis on which the Supreme Court of Oregon said the instruction was properly disallowed. The Supreme Court of Oregon said it was properly disallowed because you can take into account directly the harm to other people, isn't that the case?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":5,"text":"Okay. Why not?"},{"name":"JUSTICE ALITO","id":9,"text":"And what about footnote 3, on page 18(a)? On the last sentence says, if the jury cannot punish for the conduct which is harming others, then it is difficult to see why it may consider it at all."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":8,"text":"Because you read it's about harm. You say look here is the person doing something absolutely awful, I mean really awful. And look at how awful it is. It's the kind of thing that would have hurt X number of people badly, maybe kill them."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":8,"text":"Now I think we all agree that that's an appropriate thing to say. And as long as you can say that why can't you create serious damages for that type of conduct?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":4,"text":"What do you say, I mean Justice Alito asked you a question about the footnote. And I, in all candor I think you told us more about the, your case than about the footnote, but let me ask you basically the same question about what the Oregon Supreme Court meant in the passage that runs from the bottom of 20(a) up to 21. It says \"Philip Morris's proposed jury instructions would have prohibited the jury from punishing the defendant for the impact of its alleged misconduct on other persons even if those other persons were Oregonians who were harmed by the same conduct that had harmed Williams, and in the same way. As we noted that is not correct as an independent matter of Oregon law,\" and so on. That is not a totally unambiguous statement. I will concede that, but isn't the most obvious reasoning, reading of that a reading that says you can punish for harm to others, so long as those others are Oregonians and not people in other States?"},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"text":"One way to look at what it meant is what you argued below, I'm looking at the joint appendix page 199(a), the plaintiff's counsel in Oregon to the jury: \"How many people do you see outside driving home smoking cigarettes?\" Now, that type of argument is perfectly appropriate to assess reprehensibility. On the other hand, with the instruction that was offered the defense counsel could have warned the jury keep in mind you can't punish for those other people. We only have one plaintiff before us and we are assessing the reprehensibility with respect to that plaintiff. But without the instruction you're allowed to argue how many people do you see in Oregon smoking cigarettes?"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":3,"text":"May I just ask you what is the division? How much of this - -"},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"text":"That has no relevance to the question of the extent to which the defendant is being punished, does it?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":8,"text":"The trouble with the more basic question, I don't know if you can answer it, but it is a problem, that when I -- most States have factors like that, or many do. Alabama did. You know, not quite as good as that, and we saw the patent fraud, you know. And there are other cases that would bring up products liability. And it's pretty hard to think of a products liability case where the jury found negligence, where they might not also find these factors. Because in a typical case, you'll get competing memos within the company. Somebody will have been hurt and likely seriously, and when you start thinking about the victim in front of you, it all looks pretty bad, and it often is, at least in this instance. And now you read these five factors, and the difficulty for me has always been, well, you read the jury factors like that and they can do almost anything. And it's that, it's that fact that anything goes that I found disturbing."},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":7,"text":"Do you say this after the fact? The jury doesn't hear this?"},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":7,"text":"It seems very odd that a major argument for constraint is something that the jury can't hear. It just goes to show, really, the irrational nature of the exercise."},{"name":"JUSTICE STEVENS","id":6,"text":"May I ask this question? Assuming there's a distinction, and the instruction does, between taking into account the extent of harm to others on the one hand and punishing for the extent of harm on the other. As I understand what you recited about the five parts of the instructions, none of them really authorized punishment for harm to others."},{"name":"JUSTICE STEVENS","id":6,"text":"And is it also true that the part the Chief Justice quoted from 199(a), it seems to me that could be an argument that you should take into account the extent of harm to others, but it does not seem to me to be an argument that you can punish on. And the question I want to ask, are there other parts of the closing argument in which plaintiff's counsel argued that you should take into account, that you should punish for harm to others?"},{"name":"JUSTICE ALITO","id":9,"text":"Do you think juries can, Oregon juries or juries anywhere can understand what they are told if they are told, you can take into account conduct directed at other people for the purpose of assessing how reprehensible the conduct is, but you can't punish for the harm that is caused other people?"},{"name":"JUSTICE ALITO","id":9,"text":"They can understand that distinction and - -"},{"name":"JUSTICE ALITO","id":9,"text":"And you would have them apply that principle in this case?"},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"text":"Well, if they can understand that distinction, why wasn't the defense counsel entitled to argue to the jury just as you argued, you can consider the harm to others in assessing reprehensibility, why couldn't the defense counsel say, but, you can't punish for the harm to others, if as you answered to Justice Alito, a jury can understand that distinction?"},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"text":"So you think it would have been, putting aside what they proposed, if they had proposed an instruction that said, you may consider the harm to others in assessing how reprehensible the conduct is but you may not punish Philip Morris for the harm to others, you would have had no objection to that instruction?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":5,"text":"So your only objection is that they left out the reason why it is relevant to determining what the ratio should be? They just didn't say you can consider it in connection with reprehensibility. Why is that crucial?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":5,"text":"But why was it critical?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":4,"text":"Why was it critical?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":4,"text":"Yeah. Justice Scalia said, you know, they left out this one little bit. Why was that critical? What's the answer."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":4,"text":"You're saying, I think you're saying the jury couldn't have figured that out without somebody telling them?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":4,"text":"Isn't that what you're saying?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":5,"text":"Too favorable to you. Too favorable to you again, right?
