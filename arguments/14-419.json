Now a bank robber goes in, he has a pile of money, he puts it into a separate bank account, he uses that bank account to pay his rent, to pay other expenses, and he uses the money that would have gone for the rent and other expenses to pay a lawyer.

And --  and so it goes back to the Chief Justice's question in --  in the sense of there's a very powerful intuition behind your argument, but it's a powerful intuition that was explicitly rejected by us.

So at the beginning of the case, the question is whether the defendant can spend that money to hire the attorney of the defendant's choice, which is certainly a very powerful interest, or whether that money, at the end of the case if there is a conviction, is going to go to the victims.

I mean, the first principle is if, in fact, the defendant has somebody else's money that he's taken unlawfully, and he has to give it up at the end of the trial, we can make him give it up at the beginning to make sure it's there. Now let's try it with the facts here. If a defendant has some money, which maybe he will have to pay in a fine, what we'll do is we'll take all his money away before he's been convicted beyond a reasonable doubt. Okay. That's the difference in the propositions. Alderson Reporting Company And I'm saying it's pretty hard for me to think in a country which says that before he's convicted, you have to release him on bail except in unusual circumstances, that nonetheless, you can take all his money away so he can't hire a lawyer. I know that's a little simpleminded, but nonetheless, that seems fairly basic. I don't know where it comes from."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":9,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"That's correct. That is the principle, and now we make a number of exceptions. And one exception is if you think he's going to -- I mean, I can think of exceptions where we do keep people in jail. That is, of course, right. And -- and here, what they're saying, I think, in essence is, let's try and think of an exception for this one. Pretty hard. And anyway, if there is one, what he wants to use the money for is to make sure he has a lawyer. It's called the Sixth Amendment. All right. Now, there we are. That's where I -- at this moment in my mind, that's where the case Alderson Reporting Company is."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":9,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"I think -- I think that's a -- what you say is, look, this is equivalent to the case where we keep the guy in jail because he might run away. That's your point. That's not a bad point. So I have on that on one side, and I have on the other side that he'd like to have a lawyer which is a Sixth Amendment right. So I have a suggestion that I want you to focus on. The suggestion is -- let's read this statute in light of what you've said, that there is an interest on your side and there is a constitutional amendment on Alderson Reporting Company the other side. Why can't we read this statute to say they accommodate those interests in this way? If they're going to run away from -- with the property, then the court has the authority to enjoin the alienation or disposition of property, say tainted, then you can ask for a restraining order to prohibit the prohibition, not just of the tainted property but also of property of equivalent value. If I read that without knowing the background, I would say a lot of cases come up where you get TROs, where they're not precise because you don't know exactly what property you're talking about. So what do you think about reading this statute to avoid the constitutional question to say the TRO means TRO? And a TRO means where there's some property out there and it may be tainted, mixed up with the untainted, you can get a TRO on the whole thing. You have to have a speedy hearing. He has to be represented. And your purpose of that is to separate the two kinds of assets.
