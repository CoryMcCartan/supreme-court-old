I mean, that's -- that's not the test for an officer, how much you're paid.  The test is  whether you exercise significant authority under the laws of the United States.

Earlier, in response I think to Justice Ginsburg, you were queueing closer to the Solicitor General's position that this has to be limited in some way.  And you said you'll let them establish the boundaries.  I don't want to let them establish the boundaries. I want you to tell me, is it criminal law enforcement agents, is it law enforcement agents with -- acting -- as the Ninth Circuit says -- acting within a law enforcement activity?  Because I am finding it hard to figure out why we shouldn't permit tort liability on an OSHA inspector, who, in inspecting whatever he or she is inspecting punches someone or does some intentional assaultive act, why they should be permitted to do that.

Why is it if all the statute is concerned about is the status of being a law enforcement -- investigative or law enforcement officer -- why is it that the exception it makes does not eliminate the exemption for libel, slander, misrepresentation, deceit or interference with contract rights? There is excepted from the provisions of the Tort Claims Act any claim arising out of assault, battery, false imprisonment, false arrest, malicious prosecution, abusive process, libel, slander, misrepresentation, deceit or interference with contract rights. However, for -- for purposes of this exemption from the exemption -- the exception from the exemption, they leave out the latter part.  Why did they only put in the others?

But let me ask this:  Are there any studies or any statistics we can look at to see as a predictive matter how many prison suits against the government this ruling that you propose would -- would cause?  It seems to me we have close to 200,000 Federal prisoners, I think, and this prison work, there is a lot of shoving, guards have to break up fights. So there is going to be any number of instances where the question is did the guard overreach. And if I make the assumption, and it's just an assumption because I haven't looked at any statistics, but there is -- this is going to vastly expand the number of cases in which the Government is the defendant.  Doesn't that bear on the likelihood of the congressional intent to adopt your position?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":6,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Can you suggest why Congress might have left out libel, slander, misrepresentation?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":6,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Why -- why would they leave that out if they are only looking at the office and not at the function that the person is performing?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":6,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Right.

You have used the Ninth Circuit formula."},{"name":"JUSTICE KAGAN","id":8,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Mr. Bucholtz, the statute itself has a kind of conduct-based limitation in it.  It says law enforcement officers acting within the scope of their employment. So I guess my question is, given that there is that conduct-based limitation in the statute, why one would substitute for it law enforcement officers acting as law enforcement officers?  Why wouldn't one use just the conduct-based limitation that's already there?"},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":5,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Okay.  And then -- then take that theory and track through the statute to show me how that theory works, which is what your opening argument was going to do."},{"name":"JUSTICE KAGAN","id":8,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"But again, it's not just any acts of law enforcement officers.  It's acts of law enforcement officers acting within the scope of their authority.  And now you're saying acting as a law enforcement officer.  I mean, one question I suppose I have, which is the same question that I gave to Mr. Yang, is what's the difference between those two things? And I guess the second question is:  Why would we substitute one phrase about how they have to be acting for the phrase that Congress actually used?"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":4,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Is it a limitation?  Is scope a limitation?  I thought that you -- you didn't question that, that scope is a limitation on the conduct that's covered, right?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":9,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"What does it leave out? What does it leave out, your theory?  A policeman's a law enforcement officer.  What does he do on his job that isn't in a law enforcement role?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":9,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Oh, I see."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":9,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"So your idea here is a park policeman who is engaged in law enforcement some of the time, but engaged in giving tours the rest of the time. You're saying what you would do is say when he's engaged in the law enforcement he's covered, but not when he's engaged in the tour."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":7,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"I'm sorry.  What -- what is it about a corrections officer other than the act that was committed here, which was an alleged sexual act which nobody could, except by some definition of State law, think that that ever happens naturally in the course.  But that's an intentional assault.  The very definition of the crimes that are covered assumes that it's not an act that's licensed.  So, why isn't the correction officer acting in a law enforcement capacity when he's restraining people and securing them?"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":4,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"What about the takedown that occurred here and I -- it's not uncommon.  The -- your definition includes three things, arrest, search, seizure.  And correctional officers do engage in searches of cells for contraband, and they do engage in seizures.  Those are not -- this isn't like arrest, which you point out the arrest is unusual; it's an escapee or a visitor.  But that's not true of search and seizure."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":7,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Well, what happens -- what happens in the police precinct when police officers are holding pretrial detainees?  Are they acting as police officers or as security people?  Or even when a prisoner comes back to court for a court appearance and there are U.S. marshals who guard them rather than correction officers, what are they serving as in your mind?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":9,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Well, why isn't this -- why isn't what the prison guard does law enforcement?  I mean, the law says these people are going to be locked up and he's enforcing that."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":9,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"It says he's going to be in prison under these da, da, da, da, da.  You know, all that da, da, da means the conditions of the prison, et cetera, they're all regulations, rules, statutes.  He's enforcing them, why not?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":9,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Well, so now you're saying what those three things could provide the definition?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":9,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"And are you saying that?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":6,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Well, you don't think the EPA is engaged in law enforcement when it enforces statutes and regulations, do you?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":6,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Would an officer of the EPA be a law enforcement officer when he writes a letter to a company saying, you know, you are violating section such-and-such of the statute?  Is that a law enforcement officer?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":9,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Yeah, but EPA is not what I'm thinking of, I don't think they are.  I am thinking of policemen.  Okay.  Now, one basic job of a policeman is to patrol, but not arresting people, not searching and not seizing evidence.  They are on patrol.  That's basically what they do.  All right?  Is that a law enforcement activity?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":9,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Yeah, yeah, yeah, but I mean in places -- it's Federal, I understand.  So I'm sure we can find analogies in the Federal situation to ordinary policemen."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":9,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"All right.  But FBI agents, who are the federal police, they're people on Federal enclaves, for example, there are -- they are on Federal enclaves, they act like policemen, okay."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":9,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Okay.  That's favorable.  I mean, what I'm thinking of is either you can have a broad definition or one that's going to get into trouble when we consider real policemen.  So if you have a broad one, then I don't see how prison guards get out of it. If you have a narrow one, my guess is we could find lots of Federal policemen who really are policemen who aren't doing what falls -- who are doing what falls outside your narrow definition.  I wish I could think of better examples, but I came up with the ones I did."},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":5,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"So how does that argument help your case?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":6,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"You are saying that the Government is trying to minimize the consequences of coming out its way by providing a definition of the officers covered, which will not hold.  You think it does cover a broader category of officers including OSHA inspectors, but it does not cover them when they are not engaged in law enforcement activities."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":7,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"The one other advantage of your definition is that it takes us out of workplace fights between two employees, because presumably the officers who punch each other out, if that incident occurs, aren't acting in a law enforcement capacity.  I am assuming that is part of your argument as well."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":7,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"All right.  Then it goes back to the question I asked one of your adversaries, which is all of this depends on how broadly or narrowly we define law enforcement activities. If we take it as broadly as the Government is suggesting, at moments, it would -- we could very well say, you are right, it's a law enforcement activity, but not as narrowly as some would have it be. It would include securing or detaining people, or securing or detaining people.  And it would include the Park Service person who stops a visitor and punches them out.  It would include the military personnel who stops someone and does an intentional tort against them, even though they may just be walking on the grounds rather than serving as security that particular day. So the point is, why should we give it the narrow reading you are giving, and not the broader reading the Government seems to be suggesting?"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":4,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Then scope becomes kind of a surplusage."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":4,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"It has to be a law enforcement function.  Give -- give me an example of a case where -- where scope would also be relevant, would also be applicable -- if you -- if there is a law enforcement function, then it fits.  So what does scope add?"},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":5,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"A prisoner -- a prisoner is supposed to be back in his cell block at 6:00 in the evening, he isn't, he's on the recreation yard, he's somewhat recalcitrant, and two guards carry him back to the cell block.

Would it apply to the officer who files an arrest complaint against the prisoner, and not to the security officer who just merely carries him back to his cell?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":7,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Or does some physical injury that's substantial.  So the intentional assault gets treated as an exception to this only when the security officer actually files an arrest complaint?
