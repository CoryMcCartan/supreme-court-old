And as I read this case, in the record, we have one individual, your client, who looked at an affidavit.

The tire tracks went back to a fence at the end of a long driveway. So, I looked in the record. I couldn't find the affidavit. So, I assume that's what it says. And I wanted to know what the deputy sheriff said. What they said is that your client agreed that there were tire tracks. There were tire tracks that did not go the whole length of the driveway, but, rather, tire tracks near the house, where they got the search warrant for. And, they added, that -- the deputies -- that there was rocks broken up. All right. So, we have two sides to this argument: the deputies, who might reasonably contend that they did nothing wrong; your client, who thinks they were lying. And we also have a letter that your client wrote,  where he said that these deputies are grossly inaccurate and clearly misleading. Suppose his supervisor goes to him and says, \"I think that that letter is not the right tone. Maybe you're right, maybe you're wrong; maybe they're in good faith, maybe they're not.
