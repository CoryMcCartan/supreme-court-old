Now, you have a second judgment and the officer has to talk to somebody, so he's a little more careful.  And that's a protection, not necessarily for this person, but a protection for others who maybe  weren't wobbling. All right.  So I think that's the question you're being asked.

Not every jurisdiction has prosecutors and judges who are staying up at -- you know, 3:00 o'clock in the morning on Sunday morning waiting for the phone to ring or for -- to receive some sort of an electronic message that there has been a stop and somebody wants a -- wants a search warrant.

You just send in this thing, the judge does it in an instant, it doesn't take very long at all.  It seems to me that that diminishes the protection of the Fourth Amendment to a far -- far greater extent. The idea is that the prosecuting attorney is supposed to spend some time looking at this before submitting it to the judge and the judge is supposed to spend some time examining it.

I'm not sure you've really put forth -- the essence of their argument is that you can forego the warrant requirement when you know for a fact that evidence is going to dissipate over time. Basically, they're saying this process undermines our right to get a warrant because the evidence is dissipating.
