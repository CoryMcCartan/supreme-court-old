There is no such statute, that certainly is true, but there is a Memorandum of Understanding between the Army and the EPA, and it says, quote, \"case-specific determinations\" -- and I think that includes jurisdictional determinations -- \"made pursuant to the terms of this Memorandum of Understanding will be binding on the government and represent the government's position and any subsequent Federal action or litigation regarding the case.\" So is your -- would your argument be that because this is in a Memorandum of Understanding as opposed to a statute or a regulation, the situation is different, and that is insufficient to make the jurisdictional determination reviewable?"},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Well, I don't -- I'm sorry to stop you right there, but I don't think that's right. I'm looking at the Memorandum as well, and it says in Section -- no, I'm sorry, (4)(C)(ii), it describes nonspecial cases. It says, \"For those projects not involving a special case, the DE\" -- in other words, the district engineer, the Army Corps, not EPA -- \"the DE shall make final determinations and communicate those determinations without a requirement for prior consultation with EPA.\" So while it talks about the division of authority between special cases and the mine-run cases, it certainly says something about nonspecial cases. That's what Section is titled \"Nonspecial Cases.\""},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Well, but I don't see how you can do that. I'm looking, you know, at 6(a). It says all final determinations must be in writing and signed by either the DA -- either the Army Corps person -- or the regional administrator -- the EPA person.

How can you read that as applying only to the special case determinations?"},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Yes, this MOA decides what's a special case and what's not, and it tells you what happens when it's not.

I mean, the -- the Corps comes in and says these are jurisdictional waters. And you say, yeah, well, you can go ahead. You can still dump and do everything you want and take your chances that there will be a different ruling later on down the road."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":5,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Well --  well, it's very arduous and very expensive. So for a landowner who thinks, I shouldn't be under this Clean Water Act at all, and now they have to go through this whole process, it's going to take years and cost me a lot of money."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":6,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Sometimes it doesn't. But I joined Bennett, and the reason I joined it is it says in the second prong, \"Or from which legal consequences flow.\" So I would assume that nothing in Bennett -- or I would have dissented -- is intended to overrule what I think is the great case on the matter, which is Abbott Labs. And Harlan, in Abbott Labs, explains completely and thoroughly what this Court has done in Frozen Food Express, what the Court did in Storer. And on the point you're now making, what he says specifically is the ICC order is right for review, even though it would have no effect until later. Someone decided to bring a particular action. He says that in Storer, the Commission, policy determination is ripe, even though it would not issue a television license -- that's what the policy said -- even though no specific application was before the court. So it wouldn't take effect until later. And the same thing is true precisely of the order in Abbott Labs itself. It was a statement of interpreting what the Commission would do, and nothing Alderson Reporting Company was going to happen. Nothing happened, unless later on somebody decided to violate it. Much like this. And even if they violated it, nothing would happen, unless the Commission decided to prosecute. So what Justice Ginsburg said was, once this is in effect, okay, now what happens? The person who is subject to it has to take certain steps because of the law. One, spend $150,000 to try to get an exception and fail, or two, do nothing, violate it, and possibly go to prison. Those sound like important legal consequences that flow from an order that, in respect to the Agency, is final, for it has nothing left to do about that interpretation. And B, is perfectly suited for review in the courts. So we have harm flowing from a change in legal relations, we have an agency that has nothing left to do on this particular matter, and we have a court that is perfectly suited to review it. I would say it flows from Abbott Labs, almost QED. So what is your -- what is your response to that?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Mr. Stewart, may I ask you, please don't panic by asking this question. And please don't resist it, because I know all your arguments resisting it. But assuming we disagree with you that that should be appealable, what's the narrowest way to right this that the government would like?"},{"name":"JUSTICE KAGAN","id":7,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Well, on the same lines, could I ask more generally? I mean, one of the reasons I find this case very difficult is because all over the Federal government there are compliance offices of various kinds whose function is to give advice to people. And often that advice comes with very specific recommendations. It says we will not take enforcement action if, or, we do not consider it a violation of law on the following facts. And I guess what I want to know is your view of how this program compares to various other kinds of programs like this, whether it's the -- whether it's tax opinion letters, or SEC opinion letters, or FCC or whatever, how this program compares to those and where you could draw sensible lines, because mostly we want government agencies to do these things. We think that this helps people, to actually know what the government thinks about particular factual situations. So how do we draw lines in this area, in your view?"},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":8,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Well, I think -- I think underlying Justice Kagan's question is that the Clean Water Act is unique in both being quite vague in its reach, arguably unconstitutionally vague, and certainly harsh in the civil and criminal sanctions it puts into practice. What's the closest analogous statute that gives the affected party so little guidance at the front end?"},{"name":"JUSTICE ALITO","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Well, let's -- let's say in a case where there hasn't been a stand-alone jurisdictional determination and the landowner applies for a permit. The first part of the permitting process, Alderson Reporting Company as -- as I understand it, would be a jurisdictional determination; is that right?"},{"name":"JUSTICE ALITO","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Okay. And at the end of that, can the landowner get judicial review if the determination is that it -- it is subject to the Clean Water Act; or does the landowner have to go forward, in your view, with the entire -- all the rest of the permitting process before there is a possibility of an administrative appeal and judicial review?"},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":8,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Why isn't the permitting process a legal consequence under the -- the second -- the second prong of Bennett?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":6,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Then he goes to jail. I Alderson Reporting Company mean, you put in your brief he risks it. In your brief -- and I think the point raised, of course, you -- it's a good idea to give people advice. Abbott Labs takes care of that. One of the three important features of Abbott Labs is you look at it from the point of view of the Agency. And you say, how formal is it? What was there left to be done? And in this case, we have a whole set, a whole part of the CFR which is devoted this, which goes to varied -- it's called \"Jurisdictional Determination from Instructional Guidebook.\" The Army Corps of Engineers is brought in. Once they make a determination, it's called the Agency's official view. It's stated it remains in effect for five years, unless conditions change. And you, in your brief, say that the issuance of an approved jurisdictional determination marks the culmination of the distinct process by which the Corps informs a landowner whether the Corps believes that covered waters are present. So that doesn't sound like someone giving informal advice, and there's an appeal process. It sounds like a formal system of answering a question, which question is: Are these lands wetlands, Federal or not? Alderson Reporting Company Now, if you give some kind of informal advice, fine. You'd come to a different result. But I've just listed the things here that suggest it isn't at all formal. It's a five -- informal. It's a five-year formal, definite procedurally guided CFR determination."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":6,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"All right.

And the concern Alderson Reporting Company on the other side, beyond the EPA, is this is a vast Federal government. And this vast Federal government can operate -- can issue many, many formal determinations on aspects of the statute. And if people are -- people are required to follow those, without court review, on penalty of going to jail if they don't just follow it, or are paying hundreds of thousands of dollars, what happens to judicial review? That, I think, is also a public policy question."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":5,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"At least there's an opportunity to certify the question to say it's interlocutory, but there's a good reason why it should go up immediately.

That's what we think now, but it's not binding. It's a deliberate attempt to make this determination formal and binding on the Agency. This is our position. It's a final adjudication of our position on the jurisdictional question."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":5,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Why was it done this way, to make it this formal adjudication, rather than we'll give you advice?"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":5,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Was there -- was there anything in it for the EPA or the Corps?

In this situation, I don't see that inducement as existing, meaning I doubt very much that landowners are -- who wanted to use their property for a particular purpose are going to appeal just for the -- just to delay the government's adjudication of an issue that's going to either permit them or not permit them to Alderson Reporting Company go forward."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Well, I --"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Yes.

So is that the argument that you want to rely on?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":4,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"He just said before that if we rule that way, they could change it. They'll just eliminate the MOA."},{"name":"JUSTICE KAGAN","id":7,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Mr. Hopper, can I ask, you know, I was just looking through some other agency's rules and practices. And I'll just give you a couple of examples. The FCC put out rules just this past year, and it says --  with respect to some particular matters, the FCC rules say, the bureau will not bring an enforcement action against a requesting party, a requesting party meaning somebody who requested an opinion, with respect to any action taken in good faith reliance upon an advisory opinion if all of the relevant Alderson Reporting Company facts were fully, completely, and accurately presented to the bureau. Now, there's another that I just came across. It's in just a standard SEC, Securities and Exchange Commission, opinion letter. And it says, based on the facts presented, the division will not recommend enforcement action to the Commission. So I guess my question is, this appears to happen all over the place around the Federal government, people setting up offices whose specific purpose is to say come to us, tell us our problem, and we are going to give you a view, and not just a view; we're going to essentially commit that if you have told us the truth, here is your answer, and you can take it to the bank. And I guess I want to know what's different about this than any of the other cases in which the Federal government does that. For good reason. Because people want to know these things."},{"name":"JUSTICE KAGAN","id":7,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Well, these are -- this is very strong language that are in these letters. We will not recommend action. We -- we will not bring an enforcement action. So, you know, just as you say, this basically says to us we were in the clear if we passed this. So do these letters."},{"name":"JUSTICE KAGAN","id":7,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Let me ask you about that, because that's certainly -- this -- this process does last a long time, and it's -- even Mr. Stewart, I think, would say this is a more formal process than many that are -- that exist around the Federal government. But I guess I'm wondering about the incentives of the kind of distinction that you would make. Because it would suggest, you know, that agencies Alderson Reporting Company should not -- should draw back, should not give a fully informed view, should not do the fact-finding that the board -- that that -- the Corps does here. You know, should -- should just make their processes less formal, but in -- in making their processes less formal, also less accurate and less helpful. And I guess I wonder who that benefits in the end."},{"name":"JUSTICE KAGAN","id":7,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Well, I guess I don't quite understand that, because it seems as though they could make it less formal, and they could provide less Alderson Reporting Company assurance, and -- and still, there would be very few people who would want to run the gauntlet. And so you wouldn't gain anything. All you would do was to lose something, and what you lose is accurate, reliable information provided to people about whether, in fact, these waters are -- fall within the Clean Water Act."},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":8,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Tell us --  just --  it's in the briefs, but what --  what's the cost to get a --  a JD determination in a case such as yours?

If the JD process didn't exist, your client would be facing the exact same predicament.

And maybe that's correct, although I understood what you were saying earlier to suggest that that's not quite how you see the process; that they do this for their own purposes because they -- it expands their enforcement power, because landowners who have a question about the status of their land have strong incentive to ask for a jurisdictional determination. And if -- so that alerts the Corps to the fact that this is a property that might be subject to their jurisdiction.

It tries to divide such things with that word, \"final,\" as rulemaking by the Agency, from accomplishing roughly the same result by never having a rule but just telling everybody informally what the Agency will do in such circumstances. It might be that the formal is, other things being equal, final Agency action in respect to that matter. It might be that the latter is not. So I think what you're telling me is what I should do next is go read those Federal rules and regulations and see, is this more like informal advice, or is it more like formal rulemaking?
