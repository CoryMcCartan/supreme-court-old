You're trying to -- you're trying to make the police officers' actions unlawful, and I will stipulate that if their actions were unlawful you have a different case, and probably the evidence would have to be suppressed, but I didn't think we were here to decide that, whether they knockedtoo loud, whether they threatened to kick in the door.
