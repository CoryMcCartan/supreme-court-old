I mean, you say that the proper thing to do, now a charge labelled Form 5 has been filed, is to dismiss this lawsuit; and then we wait 60 days; and the identical lawsuit is reinstated. Why shouldn't the court simply toll the case and say, now we have a proper Form 5. The employer didn't get a chance to engage in settlement. So we hold on to the case and allow the 60 days to elapse, and then the complaint is there. Why isn't that the appropriate solution for this case?"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":5,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"But you said the same complaint could be filed at the end of the conciliation. What difference does it make that you have a piece of paper there? What I don't understand is the only effect of your position -- dismiss the whole thing, 60 days, start over -- is you're making the plaintiff file an additional filing fee. The complaint has already been filed. The filing fee has been paid. Now, everything would work out just the same except the plaintiff has to pay a second filing fee. In the court there are certain inefficiencies if it's first dismissed and then they have to docket it again. So I don't see any -- it doesn't seem to make any sense to me."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Well, I think -- I think you're right about that. I mean, once the lawyer's involved and they're in litigation and all that, they're not going to take conciliation efforts with the same light as before. But the question is whether the remedy for that, which is some unfairness to you, is to throw the suit out or try to fix it as much as possible, such as through a stay or dismissing without prejudice or something. Why should the Plaintiff -- it's not his fault that the EEOC didn't notify you.

I mean, that -- that seems to me a very strange argument. You say since -- since the EEOC must give notice when a charge is filed, if it doesn't give notice, no charge has been filed. That doesn't make sense. I mean, it's just like saying, you know, you have a civil rule, a rule of civil procedure, that says, you know, after a complaint has been filed there shall be an answer within 60 days.

This whole situation can be traceable back to the agency, and I -- whoever ends up bearing the burden of it, it's the agency's fault, and this scheme has to be revised."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":7,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Excuse me."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":7,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"That's within 10 days of the charge, but that assumes, it seems to me, what's to be proven.

The three criteria that it has certain information in it can't be the rule. It can't be the rule because we already know that it isn't a charge if the person says I don't want it to become public. So, where do I read the rule that you just said? That it -- an intake questionnaire that satisfies these three conditions becomes a charge if it reflects the manifest intent of the person who files it that it be a charge. You said that. That's a pretty modestly clear rule, except it isn't totally. And they qualify -- where do I read that?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":8,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"We use the word there \"manifest intent\"?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":8,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Ah. Well, I read those regs, and those regs had a definition that can't possibly be right as applied to \"intake questionnaire,\" because they make it a charge when the person says I don't want notice. So we know that isn't the thing. I also know what you just said does sound like a rule. I just want to know where to read it, because I don't think you'd refer to a rule of an agency, though normally we do -- but you don't refer to a rule that doesn't exist; you don't refer to a rule that nowhere can be found; you don't refer to a rule that is internally inconsistent.
