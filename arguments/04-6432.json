And so I can accept everything you say, but if that in the back of my mind is a concern running around Congress in this way, what form of words could you put in to restrict 60(b) to its domain which is the domain in which it's been used so far?

Number one, your statute of limitations claim is not the kind of claim that AEDPA is concerned with when it deals with limits on second and successive petitions. Number two, although a statute of limitations issue is on the merits, it is not on the merits in the second or successive petition category. In this case, you don't have to worry about making a -- an -- an AEDPA end run so far as second or successive goes, and therefore, 60(b) can be used simply not as a wide-open door, but as a door that could be opened when your claim is a claim about a rule that barred you from getting into Federal court, which is what the statute of limitations rule does.
