If that's generally true in a tort suit, and my guess is in a contract suit for breach of contract, if the contracting party sent the ships out and you knew that it wouldn't be delivered, it's not actionable until it isn't delivered and I guess there are ways around that, but my point is generally in the law where the matter complained of is a certain kind of incident in the world, negligence leading to harm, action of a discriminatory, et cetera, nature that leads to a discharge, normally the statute of limitations begins to run when the harm occurs. Now why should it be any different here?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":10,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Of course, he could have, but we're talking about only the constructive discharge part.

So you've got emails that say, Mr. Green is causing trouble for us by charging us with discrimination, we're going to do A, B, C, D and E to force him to retire.

So nothing more is done. There are all these acts up to a certain point, and then days, days pass and the employee resigns, but the employer has all along had the intention of forcing the resignation. So on the date of the resignation the employer intends to cause a discharge for discriminatory reason."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":10,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"That's the -- now, I'm getting this more clearly because your response to my question, which is now relevant to this too, is, look, the plaintiff was hurt on the very day that last act was performed, indeed he suffered because he saw the act being performed, and that was one of the things that led him later to quit. So let's count that as the injury. And let's count the whole thing complete as of that time. That's basically the argument for your side, I think. And now the argument against you is that's going to be a nightmare. Because there will be in fact a whole range of acts, a whole series in many cases and will then, in order to run the statute of limitations, have to get into the question of which of those acts -- maybe there were some he didn't know about -- which of those acts actually did produce harm and which did not.

You would say, no, there's two independent things and now he can bring a termination claim."},{"name":"JUSTICE KAGAN","id":7,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"And the power of the constructive-discharge claim is to say the exact same thing really has happened here, that once you lose the job, it's more than the stakes have been raised.
