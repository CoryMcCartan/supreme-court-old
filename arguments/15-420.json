I mean, let's say there are procedural deficiencies in one of the predicate prosecutions. And, you know, the defendant says, okay, well, it was a misdemeanor. He --  he doesn't seem to be terribly troubled by convictions, anyway, but --  so he says, I'm not going to seek review of that. But then later on, the prosecution comes along. Is he just sort of stuck with the prior allegedly deficient prosecution because he didn't bring every challenge he possibly could have at that time?"},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Well, maybe he didn't have any --  maybe he didn't have any reason to challenge it. I mean, my hypothetical assumes a --  a predicate offense conviction that the defendant may not have challenged for whatever reason. And yet when the --  if I've got the numbers right --  action comes up, it turns out it's a lot more serious, which often happens in these multiple offenders. You know, it's Alderson Reporting Company three -- three strikes and you get it. But you don't necessarily know that the first strike was that -- that big a deal. It's only when it's accumulated with the others that it is."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"I don't -- I -- I saw that argument in -- in your brief, and I'm not sure I'm quite -- well, I'm not sure I agree with it. I mean, the -- the idea you're saying is that, well, if there's three offenses and on the third one, you get this much enhanced penalty, that that's only for the third one. It doesn't -- it's not being imposed for the prior two. I mean, I understand that, that you're already been convicted and sentenced under the prior two, but it seems to me as a practical matter it's fair to say that the enhancement is based on those prior two. You can't just ignore the prior two and say, no, no, it's all just about this third offense."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Bryant makes --  makes a distinction between a sentence enhancement on the one hand and the case where the prior conviction counts as an element of the current offense.

It doesn't have anything to do with inherent reliability or unreliability. In fact, if it were an uncounseled felony conviction, it might well have been that the trial judge was much more careful Alderson Reporting Company than he would be in a misdemeanor case. It's almost the opposite. I --  I understand your --  the efficacy of the clear line, but it's more formalistic than functional, it does seem to me."},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":3,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"But as Justice Ginsburg pointed out, you could make the same argument if it had been just a fine and no Sixth Amendment violation."},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":3,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"So I don't understand why Alderson Reporting Company one is reliable and the other is not reliable, other than the formalistic argument which I can understand."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":6,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"But did anybody object at that time and say this sentence is unconstitutional?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":6,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Okay, so --"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":6,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Fine. But, I mean, is anybody here now claiming that the sentence was unconstitutional at the time?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":6,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"You have? Where did you say that in your brief? Because they say you didn't."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":6,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"No, no. I'm saying in your Alderson Reporting Company brief in this Court, have you claimed that the sentence, the proceeding in the Indian court violated the Federal Constitution?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":6,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Okay. Well, then, I take it that for purposes here, you concede that. I don't see how you can get around the fact you haven't complained. So if it's a valid conviction, why can't you use it? I mean, you could --  you could sentence people to more; that's what Nichols says. You could sentence them to three times the sentence without any conviction. You would just introduce some evidence that he hit his wife before badly. You could --  you could raise the sentence if it was a civil --  if it was a civil case. And --  and there was a judgment in favor of the wife, I take it. So why can't you raise the sentence on the ground that there is a valid conviction, period? End of the case. Which is, I think, what Nichols said."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":6,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Yeah. But you have told me that you have not --  I don't see how you could send a Alderson Reporting Company person to prison on the basis of the -- the lack -- where there's no counsel. If the Indian tribes can do that, then I don't see why the Federal government can't later use it if that's valid."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":6,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"And then we should hold that -- I guess, that all of the convictions in all the tribes that are using, going to jail where people might go to prison for more than six months or at all, for a day, all those are invalid."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":6,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Then the law of Congress is unconstitutional. Is that -- is that -- but no one's asked us to hold that, so I don't know that we should hold that in this case."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":5,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Well, that's the question, which is: Standing alone, was that earlier conviction violative of the Constitution?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":5,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Right. And so you're not challenging that the Bill of Rights do not apply -- because we've long held that -- don't apply to Indian courts, correct?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":5,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"They don't apply to English courts --"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":5,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"-- and other foreign courts."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":5,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"And there are plenty of foreign courts, like England for a time -- I think it's changing it now -- where they would convict people after a magisterial inquisition where the defendant didn't have counsel. You're not saying that process violates the Constitution?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":5,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"You're saying simply because we're using that conviction, we now violated. Why? Nichols, as I understand it, had two rationales: One that says using a prior constitutional Alderson Reporting Company conviction, one that doesn't violate the Constitution, is not enhancing a sentence, is not changing that earlier conviction. It's not enhancing a sentence for that earlier conviction, so you can use it, because it's just setting the platform for the current punishment, for the conduct now. How does your argument -- why does your argument change that rationale?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":5,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Well, we -- Nichols itself said enhancement statutes, whether in the nature of criminal history provisions, such as those contained in the Sentencing Guidelines, or recidivist statutes that are commonplace in State criminal law, those recidivist statutes make prior convictions an element, do not change the penalty imposed for an earlier conviction. That's what Nichols said. So the Nichols rationale covered both."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":5,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Covered sentencing guidelines and covered recidivist statutes."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":5,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"I know, but --"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":5,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Nichols said that's okay."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":5,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"No, it says it was relying on recidivist statutes that are commonplace in State criminal laws."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":5,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"All right. And those make them an element of the crime."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":5,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"That's the second prong of Nichols."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":5,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"But isn't that a due process argument?"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":4,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"I can see --"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":5,"spokeBefore":4,"sideBefore":"justices","text":"Well, that's --"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":4,"spokeBefore":5,"sideBefore":"justices","text":"--  the distinction between --  that you made between beyond a reasonable doubt and preponderance of the evidence, but practically, I mean, what's involved here is proof of a conviction entered by a court. And so you --  you Alderson Reporting Company present the certified copy of the judgment, and that's it. That satisfies proof beyond a reasonable doubt."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":4,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"What are the -- the cases both Justice Kennedy and Justice Scalia suggested that in -- not in this statute, but there are criminal Alderson Reporting Company statutes that allow the use of a foreign conviction to count for recidivism purposes, for -- for a variety of purposes.
