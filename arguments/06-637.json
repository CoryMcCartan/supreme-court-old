His parents think the public -- the placement that's proposed, the IEP that's proposed by the school is inadequate, and they turn out to be correct, and they want to send their child to the private school, but they understand this argument based on the statutory language, so they say all right, we are going to put him in the public school special education class for 11 days, so -- we've already got the placement in the private school all lined up at the end of the 11 days. He goes one day, we give notice; we take him out and we put him in the private school; then they are entitled to reimbursement subject under your argument."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"text":"Well, it depends on the particular circumstances.

It says, it codifies what the Court held. The Court didn't say anything in Burlington about the situation where the child was never in public education."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":5,"text":"I thought it wasn't that. I thought it was simply Congress figured that there are probably a lot of people in New York City, in Manhattan in particular, who are going to send their kids to private school, no matter what, and they can get special services in private school, but what the heck, if we can get $30,000 from the city to pay for it, that's fine. In other words, this was meant to be an option for people who wanted to go to the public schools but couldn't go to the public schools because they couldn't get the private services there, but it was never meant to be an option for people who had no desire to go to public schools at all anyway, and - -"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":5,"text":"-- and without this condition, somebody, I think the plaintiff here was never in the public school, was he?"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":6,"text":"Are there not children - - I think there was a brief on behalf of the Autism Society that says many school systems simply do not have the facilities to attend to the needs of these children?"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":6,"text":"Are there not cases where school districts have said from day one, look, we don't have facilities to handle this type of disability?"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":6,"text":"But isn't it true that the parent will never be reimbursed?

It's just pro forma."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"text":"I think they may - - they may well have to stay longer than 10 days to either realize that the program is inadequate or to feel comfortable that they'll be able to establish that on the record. It's pretty hard to say something's not working after only on 10 days."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":5,"text":"Of course, to be fair, this provision doesn't just apply to the rich person who wants New York City to pay 30,000 of his tuition to a private school.

You are compelling the parent nonethe less to put the kid in a program that anybody would see will -- will not meet the needs."},{"name":"JUSTICE ALITO","id":4,"text":"Is there any suggestion in the reasoning in the Burlington case that it was limited to a situation in which the student had been receiving public school special education?"},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"text":"Oh, I don't think that's true, because the problem would be you would go to the hearing to see if you were getting the adequate education and you would have -- you would essentially have to make a facial challenge rather than an as-applied one, and the school would say, well, you didn't give us a chance; we were going to do this and we were going to do that. So it would be a heavier burden to carry. The parents would have a heavier burden."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"text":"-- if they did - -"},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"text":"No, my suggestion is still that it would be easier to prevail at the impartial hearing, if you can say, look, we tried, it didn't work, as opposed to saying, we never even tried."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"text":"If I were the impartial hearing examiner, I would think that that's a harder burden for the parents to carry if they didn't even try.

Mr. Gardephe. "},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":5,"text":"What did it do, then? What meaning do you give to it?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":5,"text":"I don't understand that. It makes it very clear it is, it is (ii) which authorizes the enrollment in a private school and payment for that. And it is prefaced with a condition: If the parents of a child with a disability who previously received special education and related services under the authority of the public agency, enroll the child in a private -- the implication is if there were parent of a child who was not so enrolled, this provision does not apply. So then you fall back on the fact that the old provision covered in our cases would have applied but that makes this meaningless. I mean if you say that our prior cases overrode that limitation, then what purpose does the limitation serve?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":5,"text":"Where else does it say that the city will pay for the cost of a private education except there? That's the only place it says it. And part of the requirements for getting it is that the child was receiving service at a public institution."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":8,"text":"Then why didn't Congress adequately give the equivalent of what you call the \"only if\" language when it began (iii) by saying the cost of reimbursement described in clause two? The reimbursement described in clause two is described in terms of the clause that Justice Scalia is zeroing in on."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":8,"text":"I'm sorry. I'm just not getting this. Can you rephrase that?"},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"text":"So you read - - hypothesize two statutes: One, the statute before the phrase \"who previously received special education\" was added and the statute after? You read both of those statutes the same way; right?"},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"text":"I don't understand. You read \"who previously received special education services,\" and you say that includes who previously did not receive special education services."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"text":"There would be no reason for Congress to put that language in if the same right to reimbursement existed if the child had not previously received special education services."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"text":"Because your friend reads that the exact opposite way and says, since (C)(iii) only makes sense if the child is in the public school, that that's a limitation on how you should read (C)(ii)."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"text":"In that case, isn't it pertinent that the title to (C)(ii) says \"Reimbursement for Private School Placement\"? It doesn't say reimbursement for private school placement when the child previously attended public school."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"text":"That just means that (C)(ii) doesn't address the entire universe of issues that might arise. But that doesn't mean that it doesn't address exactly what its title says, \"Reimbursement for Private School Placement.\""},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"text":"Where is that set forth?"},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"text":"Were those provisions at issue when this dispute arose? They are the 2004 amendments - -"},{"name":"JUSTICE STEVENS","id":9,"text":"You haven't identified the statutory provision that you think provides the authority for the payment in this case."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"text":"I suppose it's how broadly you read legislative history. I thought there was a statement by Representative Castle that this would limit the payments that school districts had to make."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"text":"So when it comes to reimbursement of tuition, the parents who never place their child in the public school are in better shape than the parent who place their child in public school and then want to remove him."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"text":"But cooperation does not require sending the child to the public school."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"text":"Well in my case they would note have received any benefits, under the terms of the statute."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"text":"That's why your friend says it serves the purpose of helping to make clear that the public school is -- whether it is or is not able to provide the appropriate public education. I mean, why would Congress have put the phrase in there - - even if it was describing as you say the most common situation -- why would it put the phrase in there if it doesn't serve that purpose at least?"},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"text":"What you're saying is it's not a very significant hurdle, but it is going to be a hurdle in some cases."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"text":"The useful purpose it serves is allow the school district to show what it can do in ten days, as opposed to a mere theoretical statement, it allows some actual concrete practice to see if the plan that the public school has developed is going to work or not going to work, that the impartial hearing examiner can evaluate in a more concrete setting."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"text":"But then the whole point is the statute was then amended after Burlington. So to say what Burlington interpreted, it don't seem to me to be very compelling on the question of what the amended statute provided."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":5,"text":"I'm not sure I agree -- Im not sure I would agree with you that you could get special services which --in third grade and then come back 10 years later and get private school tuition. I would really read this as saying if the parents of a child who previously received special education under the authority, enroll the child in a public elementary school -- I think that there has to be a temporal connection between the prior receipt and the enrollment. I don't think you can go back 10 years."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":5,"text":"You don't have to read it that way, anyway."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":5,"text":"Once you're in the private school reimbursement you're in the private school reimbursement, but you can't get into it 10 years later. Anyway, that issue is not -- not before us today. I don't understand you assertion that somehow this would amount to repeal by implication. The provision of 1415 -- what is it, (b), (b)(3) -- it seems to me is just like a provision for, for a court's exercise of its equitable powers. \"Shall grant such relief as the court determines is appropriate\" -- if a court had granted some equitable relief in one case, and then there is a statute that's passed which renders that equitable relief no longer appropriate, I wouldn't say that that -- that that amounts to a repeal by implication. It's just that what is appropriate depends upon the remainder of the statue, and as it exists at the time that the relief is sought."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":7,"text":"But they have (b). What about (b)? See look, there are two situations. Situation (a) is that the school district thinks they can give them a good education, adequate. Then he should go and try it out, and if by the way the school district just can't do it, then (b). So what's been wrong with that scheme? Why doesn't that cover the waterfront?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":7,"text":"Just the language -- the language."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":7,"text":"The language plus the fact that nobody can think of a reason for putting that in there, unless that's the - -"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":7,"text":"But my question was what about (b)? My question was not to argue with you. My question was, why doesn't (b) take care of the examples of absurd situations, law situations that you've mentioned?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":7,"text":"The case where the school district just can't do it."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":7,"text":"If they just can't do it then their job is to put the kid in a district - -"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":7,"text":"-- in a place that can do it. And if their argument, which is your case, is it they object to the facility, then have an argument about that, about whether it should be this private school or that private school. That's what it seems to me your case is about, and that's why I think B."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":7,"text":"(b), that's my question, (b). I thought you were right. Until I heard that. Then I suddenly hear no, that don't worry about it, judge, is what I heard, because in the situation where the school district has not provided there is another section of the statute that takes care of the child. That's what I want to hear your response to."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"text":"You have review before the impartial hearing examiner about that alleged bad faith, correct?"},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"text":"You have reviewed before the Hearing Examiner that alleged bad faith on the part of the school district."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":5,"text":"Bingo.

They passed a statute imposing a limitation on that, 10 business days."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"text":"You don't dispute that limitation. You dispute the other one, though, which says they have to have previously received special-education services."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"text":"Anywhere? I thought Representative Castle said that this would result on easing the burden on the school districts to pay tuitions."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":5,"text":"Well, that's no problem.
