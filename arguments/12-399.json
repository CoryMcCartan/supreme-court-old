I mean, just -- just in passing in the sentence, that \"the continued custody.\"  I mean, you would think if that's what they meant, they would say, \"where the child\" is -- \"is within the custody of a parent, comma, no termination of parental rights may be ordered, in the absence of a determination,\" blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. It doesn't say that.  It says, \"No termination may be ordered in absence of a determination, including testimony of a qualified expert, that the continued custody of the child by the  parent or Indian custodian is likely to result in serious emotional.\" When it's -- when it's framed that way, I am -- I am inclined to believe that the \"continued custody\" means looks to the future, the continuing custody by this person in the future.  To read into it the fact that -- that the whole provision only applies to someone who is then in custody of the child, that's very strange.

But under your interpretation, the one category of people who is exempt from that are the category of fathers who've never seen the mother. Who've seen the mother a very short time.  Who may be in -- they're not even subject to looking to see if it's very harmful to the child. So I just -- am I right about your interpretation having that effect?
