Therefore there can be no -- there can be no loss to the plan which is not a loss to an individual account, can there be?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":6,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Then what is your theory on how we determine whether a loss to the plan from an individual account suffices as a loss to the plan for purposes of pleading?

And the question before us is not whether ultimately you've stated a winning claim, but whether ultimately -- whether right now you have stated a claim for a loss to the plan. Now, that is not your view.
