Whereas if the State court never reached the harmlessness ground, and erred on -- or ruled on whether the violation occurred, whether there was any constitutional violation, then he would obtain relief if there is merely a reasonable probability of harm. Now, you know, why would there -- what does he care whether -- whether the error below consisted in an erroneous harmlessness determination or an erroneous determination that there was no violation? Why should there be a different standard of review between the two?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":5,"text":"Let's assume another violation, the court erroneously determines - - erroneously -- that there was no constitutional violation at all. Its error is not with regard to the harmlessness, but with regard to whether there was a constitutional violation. Why should there be one standard of review for one error and a different standard of review for the other, regardless of whether the State court conducted Chapman or not?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":5,"text":"You could say the same thing when the State court has erroneously determined that there was no violation. In that case, you apply the Kotteakos standard. I just don't understand the rationale of applying a higher standard to the other error."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":6,"text":"I thought the State court didn't find that there was error. I thought the State court said, this was cumulative, I'm not going to let it in."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":6,"text":"It wasn't until we got into the Federal court that there was an error found. As far as the State was concerned, there was no reason to engage in any kind of harmless error review, Chapman or not, because there was no error."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":5,"text":"And it is that determination that you are objecting to here. The harmlessness determination."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":5,"text":"But for the former, you are perfectly content with our applying Kotteakos. And for the latter, however, you say we have to apply Chapman. I just don't see the logic of that."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"text":"As I read the Court's opinion in Brecht, the Brecht standard on harmlessness is based on the structural consideration that your under collateral review at that point, rather than under direct review. You would apply a different harmlessness standard that doesn't seem to take into account the fact that it's collateral review rather than direct."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"text":"Well, I guess that's where maybe we -- is the subject of debate, whether the central theme in Brecht was, this is collateral review, and that calls for a different standard, or whether the central theme was Chapman review had been undertaken, and therefore, that calls for a different standard. I'm not sure I agree with you that the latter is the case."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":5,"text":"The dissenters certainly thought that that was the consequence, the dissenters in Brecht. They said that Kotteakos would apply even where the State court has found that \"no violation has occurred.\""},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":5,"text":"In other words, never approached the harmlessness thing. That's what the dissenters thought."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":7,"text":"And I don't think the majority said the contrary. I mean, I wrote it. I mean, I don't know -- what counts is what I wrote, not what I thought. But if you read it, I don't think it decides this question. What I wonder, though, is why does the - - how does this case present the issue you want to argue? I'm -- Justice Ginsburg made me wonder about that. As I understand it, the trial court said, I'm not going to let this witness testify, it is cumulative. All right. And then the appeals court said, well, that wasn't a mistake. And one reason it wasn't a mistake is that this witness added nothing. There could no possible prejudice, says the trial court, when he excluded that person. That means it was cumulative, that means it did nothing, and that was the appeals court. So the appeals court finds no error. Now, we get over to the Federal court. And they say, oh, no, this witness added a lot. Well, they couldn't have thought this witness added a lot to the point where the constitution is violated unless they disagreed with that decision of making no possible difference. Very well. We disagree, send it back. End of case. Now, where does it raise all this stuff about harmless error and -- I mean, when I -- it is hard for me to get my mind around this issue, because it's so complicated. How does this case raise it?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":7,"text":"Was that as a reason for there not being error? Or was it in the context of saying, well, even if there was a mistake, there was no possible prejudice. What does the footnote mean, in your opinion? The second?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":7,"text":"What is the footnote number?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":7,"text":"Okay. I'll read it."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"text":"Page what?"},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"text":"Thank you."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":7,"text":"Thank you. Very helpful. The other thing which I brought up, so I might as well get both my questions out, is that years ago I read a decision by Judge Leventhal that made a big impression on me. And he was a very good judge. It's in a different context, it's the same problem. He said, I originally thought this was the case dreamed of by law professors, a case where I could conscientiously say, although I consider the findings clearly erroneous, so I'd reverse if it were a judge's decision, nonetheless, there is support and substantial evidence. And therefore, I affirm it, because it comes from an agency. But when I think about it, I don't think there's substantial evidence either. Okay. In other words, has there ever been a case in the history of mankind where you think a judge has actually thought to himself, after reviewing the record, oh, I think that this is harmless, so I'll affirm. But I don't think it's harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, so I'll reverse. I mean, I find it very difficult to get myself in that state of mind, where I think such a thing is possible."},{"name":"JUSTICE STEVENS","id":8,"text":"If I could come back to, may I ask this question: Is part of your argument that even under the Brecht standard it was not harmless?"},{"name":"JUSTICE STEVENS","id":8,"text":"This is a case, am I correct, where there were two, two hung juries and then a five-week deliberation in this case? And there was a harmless -- and the testimony of Maples was she had seen a guy who didn't fit the description do the killing?"},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"text":"Where is that in the question presented?"},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":4,"text":"It says that if the Brecht standard applies, does the Petitioner or the State bear the burden? I guess that's the narrower question, who has the burden."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":7,"text":"But O'Neal, I thought O'Neal just says that this word \"burden of proof\" is out of place when you talk about an appellate judge reading the record."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"text":"You're now arguing that under Brecht this should not have been harmless; is that the point you're making?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":5,"text":"The trouble with reading that second question that way is that, you know, it follows from your first question, which speaks in the generality of cases. It's not speaking to this case. Your first question presented is, if constitutional error in a State trial is not recognized by the judiciary until the case ends up in Federal court, is the prejudicial impact assessed under the standard set forth in Chapman or in Brecht? That's the first question. Very generalized. Second question: Does it matter which harmless-error standard is employed? I didn't take that to mean does it matter in this case which of the two. I thought it meant, you know, is there any difference between the two standards? Don't you think that's fair reading of it."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":5,"text":"You think it means, does it matter in this case which harmless -- you think that second sentence means would, would the defendant be entitled to reversal of the conviction no matter which harmless error standard is employed? You think that's what it means?"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":6,"text":"Is that a question on which we would be likely to grant cert?"},{"name":"JUSTICE STEVENS","id":8,"text":"Would you help me with one thing I'm not terribly clear about, though. Is it clear which -- what side the magistrate thought had the burden of persuasion?"},{"name":"JUSTICE STEVENS","id":8,"text":"Does your opponent now concede that the State has the burden?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":7,"text":"How do they say that after I thought I wrote an opinion for the majority of the Court which said this concept is not applicable in - - when you're reviewing a record for harmless error. It's not a question of presenting evidence. What I think it said is that it's not a question of presentation of evidence. In such a case, we think it's conceptually clear for the judge to ask directly, do I the judge think that the error substantially influenced the judge's -- the jury's decision? Now, maybe I was wrong, but I think there was a majority of the Court that agreed with it."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":7,"text":"To talk about burdens of proof?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":7,"text":"Yes. But that's my basic question in this case and it's a serious question. Suppose I think, which I do think, that I as a judge can conscientiously review a record and decide for myself whether I think this error of the judge was harmless, and if I really try I can bring myself to understand this question. Regardless of what I think, could another judge, say a State judge, reasonably have thought the opposite? I can do that mentally. You try to get me to make more fine distinctions than that, I cannot do it. I can't. I'm sorry. I admit it. Now, if that's the state of mind that I can get myself into -- and I believe that's true of many judges -- how do I write words that are realistic in this area?"},{"name":"JUSTICE ALITO","id":10,"text":"There are many situations in which an appellate court has to apply a legal standard to facts in criminal cases and civil cases. In a criminal case, an issue on appeal could be whether there's sufficient evidence to support the verdict. Do you think there's a burden of persuasion on appeal on all of those issues?"},{"name":"JUSTICE ALITO","id":10,"text":"What's the difference between that and applying any harmless error standard? It's exactly the same kind of analysis. It's a different legal test, but you're applying, you're applying the law to facts."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":6,"text":"Are you talking about what's on the bottom of page 181 of the joint appendix? That was the only place that I found where the magistrate expressed a view on this. It reads: \"The court does not find that there has been\" -- \"the court does find that there has been an insufficient showing. So that \"insufficient showing\" means showing by the Petitioner.\" Is that what you're relying on?"},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"text":"That wouldn't help us resolve the conflict in the circuits between which standard is applicable, though, right?"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":6,"text":"And that would put 2254 out of sync with 2255, where I understand if it's a Federal conviction then it's always Brecht on post-conviction relief?"},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"text":"Thank you, Mr. Haltom. Mr. Moody. "},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":6,"text":"You said in your brief that the remedy, if the Petitioner wants to assure he's going to get Chapman review someplace, then he should have sought cert -- direct review from the State court's conviction. Did you say that?"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":6,"text":"But realistically, the likelihood that such a petition would be successful, passing the problem that the Petitioner is not likely to have a lawyer, does the likelihood that this Court would grant cert on such a question is very slim."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":5,"text":"I suppose you could say that of all the questions that go into habeas under 2254, that they could have brought up directly but the chances are their being taken here are negligible?"},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"text":"Counsel, if the State court had conducted a Chapman review, erroneously, how would that be reviewed under Federal habeas? You would ask under AEDPA whether it was an unreasonable application of Chapman?"},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"text":"That seems awfully refined, doesn't it, to do two different analyses? Is this an -- is this an unreasonable application of Chapman? And then apply the Brecht standard after determining that it was an unreasonable application of Chapman?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":7,"text":"Suppose we apply Brecht. This is what I'm having to little trouble with but I'd appreciate your commenting or straightening this out. The Ninth Circuit holds two things according to the SG in the briefs. He states them very well. The first is let's look at this witness. The testimony was excluded. Now the Ninth Circuit says that exclusion was unreasonable of -- an unreasonable application of clearly established Federal law, because that testimony of the witness that was excluded was not only material, it would have substantially bolstered the claim of innocence. So that's their finding on the merits. Then they go on to say, but the exclusion was harmless. How could both those things be true? How could it be true that the reason that there was error in excluding it was that the evidence is so important that it substantially bolsters the claim of innocence? That's one thing they say. But the exclusion was harmless. I just fail to understand how anyone could think both those things. But maybe in the context of the case it was possible, but that's what I'd appreciate your explaining."},{"name":"JUSTICE ALITO","id":10,"text":"Why is it necessary for us to try to reconcile those two statements? The Ninth Circuit may well have been wrong in finding that there was a violation at all, but we have to assume that, for purposes of the question that's presented to us. So why shouldn't we just analyze the harmless error question independently of what they said about whether there was a Chambers violation?"},{"name":"JUSTICE ALITO","id":10,"text":"Well, every time evidence is excluded on the grounds that it is cumulative, or is the equivalent of a 403 balancing in Federal Court, there's not a constitutional error under Chambers and related cases, is there?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":11,"text":"May I go just back to Justice Breyer's question for a second?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":11,"text":"And I mean, I think your answer to Justice Breyer was a very good answer as a, as sort of a general statement. But in -- would you agree that in this case, if we -- if we do proceed, number one, to agree with you that Brecht is the standard, and we then do proceed to apply Brecht here or to determine whether Brecht was properly applied here, that in this particular case, the, the record indicates that the case was so close that there would have to be a finding of harmful error, or at least it would be impossible to find harmless error. Even applying Brecht clear. And you know what I'm getting at. I mean, five weeks of deliberation. The question after, whatever it was, two weeks, and four ballots, and so on. Obviously this -- this case was just to tottering on the edge. So even if we, if we do get to the point of applying Brecht, wouldn't it be impossible to say that he's -- he gets no relief under Brecht?"},{"name":"JUSTICE STEVENS","id":8,"text":"But two or three of those did it on an improper ground, that you agree with now, don't you?"},{"name":"JUSTICE STEVENS","id":8,"text":"For purposes of argument."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":6,"text":"It was two to one in the Ninth Circuit."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":6,"text":"Judge Rawlinson I think said that using the Brecht standard, that there was actual prejudice."},{"name":"JUSTICE STEVENS","id":8,"text":"Isn't this the -- I may have it wrong -- but isn't this the case in which the witness was unique not cumulative because she was the only one who was completely disinterested."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":11,"text":"Five, five weeks?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":11,"text":"Do you know of any other case in which the jury deliberated for five weeks?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":11,"text":"I'm sure there's an example somewhere, but I -- I practiced law for over 40 years, and I never heard of it."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":6,"text":"At what point, how many weeks had gone by when they said they were hung?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":7,"text":"So - -"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":7,"text":"Go ahead."},{"name":"JUSTICE STEVENS","id":8,"text":"Did they ask for a read back of Mrs. Maples' testimony?"},{"name":"JUSTICE STEVENS","id":8,"text":"Oh, that's right. Of course."},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":4,"text":"Well, maybe, maybe you'd end up - -"},{"name":"JUSTICE STEVENS","id":8,"text":"Well, maybe a critical witness was left out. That argues the other way, I think."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":7,"text":"But what she heard was that they were going to kill, this other person was going to kill a man and a woman, and it turned out that that was the crime at issue."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":7,"text":"What did she hear?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":7,"text":"Do you think -- do you think, do you think I should do this? I'm still looking, I'm worried about on the one hand, as you are, having this Court announce too many six-part tests, and having a lot of words and it becomes easy to make a mistake for a judge and then you never finish a proceeding. I'm worried about that, as are you."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":7,"text":"At the same time, I think what counts is what the judge does, the reviewing judge. Not what -- quite what the test says. So there has to be a conscientious effort to decide, was there -- was it harmless? Could a reasonable jurist in California have concluded the opposite? Okay. So maybe we should do it in this case. We simply try ourselves to go through this record, make that determination to show by example, rather than by trying to find a form of words."},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":4,"text":"The third party perpetrator that Maples was going to talk about according to the prosecution's theory, was Hurtz or Hearst?"},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":4,"text":"And there -- there was a link between Hurtz, there was an acquaintanceship between Hurtz and the victim?"},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":4,"text":"Was that established in other testimony or would that all have come out just only through Maples?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":11,"text":"Otherwise, I mean, they couldn't have found it was cumulative if -- if that had not been the case."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":11,"text":"But -- on appellate review in California, they found it cumulative, didn't they?"},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":4,"text":"Right. Okay."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":11,"text":"And they -- they couldn't have found that if there hadn't been some evidence on Hurtz, apart from Maples?"},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":4,"text":"How did Hurtz's name enter into the trial?"},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":4,"text":"Why did anybody mention him?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":11,"text":"And if Maples' testimony had come in, I presume they could have cross-examined him on the basis of Maples' testimony?"},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":4,"text":"Did he say he'd killed peoples otherwise, or at other times?

That goes to the weight, not the admissibility."},{"name":"JUSTICE STEVENS","id":8,"text":"So we don't assume that he's committed a whole lot of killings, I don't suppose?"},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"text":"Do you think the question of the application of Brecht is included within the questions presented?"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":6,"text":"But on the other side, State courts say, we don't have, we don't have to bother in any case with Chapman because when it goes over into the Federal court they're going to apply Brecht."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"text":"Thank you, counsel. Ms. Millett? "},{"name":"JUSTICE STEVENS","id":8,"text":"May I ask two questions and then you can proceed. One, do you take a position on who has the burden of persuasion? That's the first question.
