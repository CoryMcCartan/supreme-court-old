It is better to have this in the bank instead of not."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":6,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Is that internal discipline verifiable?

General McAllister said that in the Fifth Amendment area we -- we indeed allow - - allow it to be introduced in rebuttal even though that is the actual constitutional violation. Isn't that the case other than in the Miranda situation? I mean, suppose you have a generally coerced confession. Would we -- would we permit that to go in?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":5,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Exactly, but why -- why is not that the case with the right to counsel?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":5,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"But its real meaning is that counsel is guaranteed at trial; isn't that right?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":5,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Its root purpose is that counsel is guaranteed at trial.

Is that right?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":8,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"I have my memo that I haven't looked through carefully, but I would be quite interested. I thought he asked for counsel. He was given counsel, and subsequent to that, this statement was elicited. I would like to know that because the Sixth Amendment says you have right to assistance of counsel in your defense, period. And I guess, if he had a lawyer, the lawyer could have told him, \"Don't talk to informants in the jailhouse.\" He could have said, \"I'm going to talk to who I want.\" Or he might not have. But I would be interested in knowing, did he have assistance of counsel at the time the statement was elicited? It's one thing to me if he did, and another if he didn't. Don't know?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":8,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"How can I find out?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":8,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"So it might be he asked for counsel but hadn't yet received counsel?"},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Counsel, do I understand the first sentence on page 6 of your brief to concede that there's no deterrent value from prohibiting the introduction of these statements for impeachment? The sentence says, \"A Sixth Amendment exclusionary rule that allowed use of uncounseled statements for impeachment would not deter violations of the right to counsel.\""},{"name":"JUSTICE ALITO","id":9,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"So in a situation like we have here, where the law enforcement officers do not instruct the informant to do anything that would violate the Sixth Amendment and in fact, according to their testimony, instruct him to engage in conduct that is consistent with the Sixth Amendment, there's no deterrent value in later suppressing the use of the statements for impeachment purposes?"},{"name":"JUSTICE ALITO","id":9,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"But what do you want to deter? You want to deter them from using informants at all, even in a manner that is consistent with the Sixth Amendment?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":8,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"I see the problem. I wonder if you have an answer to another question. You may not. I can't find it. It seems to me it's been 20 years since this -- nearly 20 -- since the Court decided the Michigan case. The other cases were decided even earlier. And it's just surprising to me that it has never come up or rarely, rarely come up that the question of whether the State can introduce into evidence a statement made when the State questioned an individual who'd asked for counsel or had counsel out of the presence of the counsel. I mean, does that normally happen, or does it never happen? Why is there so little law on it? Do you have any idea?"},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"You agree with the representations on -- from your friends on the other side that there is no case of ours where we have excluded a statement of evidence submitted for impeachment, even though it would have been excluded in this case in chief? If you prevail here, it would be the first time that any evidence or statement has been excluded when submitted for purposes of impeachment?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":8,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"That's what I'm not certain about. And this is why I ask -- have been asking these questions and what I can't figure out in my own mind is this. I ask for a lawyer. The State has some period of time to give me a lawyer. Now it's one thing if what's going on is once I ask for a lawyer, the State should deal with me through my lawyer; that's how they are supposed to do it. But that isn't as basic - - that's like a rule of ethics in most States in civil context and other contexts -- that's not as basic as if I ask for a lawyer and then the State just doesn't give me one, though it should. That's a different violation, a different kind of violation. One is a kind of a rule of ethics incorporated in the Constitution. The second is what the case is -- is what the Constitution is really about, give him a lawyer when he asks for one. And which is this case? That -- that's why I'm having hard time. Is it the first or the second?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":8,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"No, no, no. I will amalgamate that for you. I will say they are exactly the same thing. But what I want to know is what rule is violated, what Sixth Amendment rule. The rule -- you heard what I said, the rule \"don't talk to a guy who wants a lawyer until you talk to the lawyer.\" No communications with a client. It's a communication with the lawyer. That's one thing. And the other rule is he has asked for a lawyer but you never gave him one. Now which is this case? I mean, I first thought well if he didn't have a lawyer at all, then it must be the second; but then I thought they must have a reasonable time to give him a lawyer, and they haven't violated that second. If you have any view on that, it would be helpful to me."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":6,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"But we do know that unlike the police giving Miranda warnings, there's no warning here at all. I mean, he thinks he is talking to a cellmate. Nobody tells him, \"remember you've got a right to be represented by counsel,\" and he's essentially giving a statement without the Miranda warnings."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":6,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"But the other side says well, practically, the defendant is much more likely to say something that's really involuntary when he is confronting police officers, that the reason that we exclude in the case of a police officer is this intimidating setting, when the defendant is in the police station or in the cell and there are these police officers. Now he thinks he's just with a cellmate, so there isn't -- there isn't the coercive atmosphere that there is when the police do the questioning."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Counsel, you've - - you've emphasized that what distinguishes this case from the other ones where we have allowed evidence that would be excluded from the case in chief and for impeachment purposes is that this is a trial right. But the Sixth Amendment says in criminal prosecutions you have a right to the assistance of counsel. Well, he had assistance of counsel here, and one of the things that counsel did was point out the problems with relying on the snitch's evidence and all the bad things that he did. But -- but just like in the case of a Fourth Amendment violation where we allow the evidence to be admitted at trial, this Sixth Amendment problem, you know, it doesn't -- I just don't see the -- the strength of that distinction."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Well, it seems to me you are getting away from the basis for your distinction, then. Saying well, it's not just at trial. Well, these other constitutional rights where we have allowed the evidence to come in for impeachment are indistinguishable from the Sixth Amendment right, outside of trial."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Just to pause on that, it affects his decision to testify because it makes it more likely that he will testify truthfully if he is going to testify."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"The focus -- the focus on the context is at least a double-edged sword because the harm that we are facilitating under your rule is to allow perjured testimony."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Yeah, and if he has the assistance at trial consistent with the Sixth Amendment, those -- those problems could be pointed out. He was -- he was he is not lying now. The reason he said something different then was, you know, he likes to brag in prison or whatever the basis is."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"I think -- I think that's quite right. But I don't see how excluding the evidence even on impeachment helps that. I mean, they've still got the statement, and they -- I mean, you know -- I guess your point, you know, maybe they will get some leads from it even if they can't use it. But excluding the evidence for impeachment purposes doesn't eliminate that harm."},{"name":"JUSTICE ALITO","id":9,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Which of the things that you've just said result from the use of this for impeachment would not be true with respect to the other situations where illegally obtained evidence has been used for impeachment purposes? Take the Fourth Amendment, for example."},{"name":"JUSTICE ALITO","id":9,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"You don't dispute that there was a Sixth Amendment violation at the time this statement was taken, do you?"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":6,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"You urged a -- a fall-back, and you said at least that there may -- there should be a determination by the judge that the defendant intentionally testified falsely. And I was wondering how that would operate. You are here in the -- the heat of the trial, and the prosecutor says, I want to call snitch so-and-so. And then what do we do, just interrupt the trial and have kind of a mini trial to test the credibility of the -- the informant?"},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Thank you, counsel.
