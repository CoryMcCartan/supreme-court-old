It didn't proceed that way at all. It says, generally, the United States can be held liable only when liability was attached to a private actor. However, the United States may be liable, quoting from one of the Ninth Circuit's earlier cases, for the performance of some activities that private persons do not perform when a State or municipal entity would be held liable under the law where the activity occurred.
