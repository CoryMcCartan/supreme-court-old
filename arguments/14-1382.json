Alderson Reporting Company So applying Carden, what you would say -- and Navarro: If you sue the trustees, you look to their citizenship. But if you sue the trust itself, you don't look to the citizenship of the trust; you don't look to the citizenship of the trustees. You go beyond that and look to the citizenship of the members. I mean, that seems odd. Why do you look to the members or the shareholders, or the -- or the beneficiaries where you sue the trust itself but you don't in the identical situation where the law of the State allows you to sue the trustees?

You say, Alderson Reporting Company well, this isn't really like a trust. I mean, it is sort of a trust, but there are important differences. They can sue and be sued. The trust itself can hold the property, and the beneficiaries do not have an equitable interest. And because they don't have an equitable interest, it's more like a private association or, et cetera, in Carden. But, of course, that means that we look to their interest. We look to their property. We're basically having them as part of the necessary parties because they have a property interest, the very people we just said that this is a different kind of organization because they lack an equitable interest in the property."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"I just have one question on the Safeway and Kraft business.
