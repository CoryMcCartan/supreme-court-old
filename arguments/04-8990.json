You think -- you have a theory under which he could have done it, and it's certainly possible in my opinion. But also you think, my goodness, if he did it, going and this luring of the woman to the creek -- you know, there's nothing else in the record that suggests he would plot in that way to do this. Nothing. The husband is away at the time from the dance. He could have done it. They are fighting. They could have done it. And if the luring theory correct, the motive was sexual, but the sexual physical evidence is from the husband, not from him. So the jury is brought into this on a theory that there is a sexual attack and the one -- by the 1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 defendant, and the one thing that seems disproved pretty much is that. And now we have two experts, Dr. Blake and Dr. Bigbee. And reading a page, which I hadn't read thoroughly until you pointed it out, I'd say they might disagree. They might disagree. And it's just not conclusive. So if you're sitting there, do you have to have a reasonable doubt when there's such strong evidence for both people? And -- and the part that's bothering me -- I -- I see what that district judge said on that one point, which he may have thought was peripheral but it turns out to be quite important about when the blood spilled. But if you look to the underlying thing and I think, well, maybe you're right, but maybe you're not right. And so how do -- how do I -- how do I do this? What's the -- what's the weighing?

What -- what about -- I want to just follow up on something that Justice Breyer alluded to and that is the significance of the DNA evidence. And I have tended to -- to think that a reasonable juror would look at it this way, but if I'm wrong, I -- I want you to comment on it. One of the -- I -- I assume, to begin with, that any reasonable juror would have found this evidence, the evidence of the semen stains, extremely significant because not only did the State argue rape as a -- as a motive, possible motive, but there was a specific finding of an aggravated circumstance that the murder occurred in the course of kidnapping and rape. I don't know of any evidence that would suggest an -- an independent kidnapping crime without the rape element under, you know, the circumstances of -- of this crime. So I'm -- I -- I assume that the reasonable juror, having come to the conclusion that that aggravating circumstance is true, found that a rape was being committed. If that juror had heard the DNA evidence, that juror would have said the only positive evidence that a rape was committed here would be evidence that pointed to the husband, not in fact to -- to the defendant House. And if -- if a juror had heard that 1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 -- evidence, it seems to me it is highly unlikely that any reasonable juror would have concluded that that aggravating circumstance was found, and I suppose that would play a -- a significant role in -- in the ultimate conclusion. Now, you have argued that the fact that the DNA evidence shows that it was the husband's fluids, not House's, doesn't conclusively prove that House didn't rape her, and of course, you're right.
