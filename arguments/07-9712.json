United States. Mr. Isaacson. "},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Mr. Isaacson, you said there were two facts. Aren't there three? Isn't it a fact that after the plea bargain the defendant in essence broke his side of the bargain by committing a crime while he was in jail?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Well, I used to teach contract law and I'll tell you that would have been a breach of contract. That would have been a breach on his part. Now, the government has conceded the breach of the plea agreement. I don't -- I can't understand why they did that, but they apparently have conceded it. Does that mean that we have to ignore it for purposes of deciding what the -- what the remedy is? Ignore the reality that there was a breach? I mean, you know, if the government said, we will ask the court to sentence at the lower end because of the -- the remorse that the defendant has shown, and the defendant then demonstrates that he has no remorse by -- you know, suppose he comes and stabs the judge -- is the government really supposed to have to go before the judge and say, \"Your Honor, this man is really remorseful and you should sentence him at the lower end\"? It seems to me it's a basic principle of contract law that a party to a contract cannot take action which makes it impracticable for the other side to carry out his part of the bargain, and that's what your client did. The government couldn't practicably go in and make that argument when he had demonstrated himself to be an unremorseful criminal."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Oh."},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":5,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"So you want to us make the inference that the impermissible or criminal activity was permitted by the absence of this specific clause. You say there is no implied condition, no implied covenant?"},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":5,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Well, the questions so far indicate that one of the promises was an implied promise that you will keep the terms of the agreement by lawful behavior. So that just -- what you say just begs the question. Now, I recognize the government has conceded a breach, and we will probably move on from that point. But, as Justice Scalia indicates, it puts the case in a very artificial posture, it seems to me."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"And there is nothing theoretically inconsistent with the government -- you can feel remorse. I mean, you're not going to do it again. You going to feel remorse every time you do it, but that doesn't mean he didn't feel remorse from the crime he was pleading to."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"But this judge said - - and he was open in his thinking. He said: \"Unheard to me that I would give acceptance of responsibility credit to someone that as soon as he gets sent to jail is out there committing another crime.\""},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"The judge did say that. He said it was unknown to him that judges give acceptance of responsibility credit to someone who in the interval between the plea and when he shows up in court for sentencing commits another crime."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":6,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Your point is not that he should have gotten the reduction. Your point is that the government should have made the recommendation."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":6,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Isn't it? Isn't that your point?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":6,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"The agreement called for them to make a recommendation and they didn't make it. In fact, they recommended the contrary. And that's your gripe, right?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Where is that in the record, do you know offhand? Where the plea agreement is?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Thank you."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"spokeBefore":4,"sideBefore":"justices","text":"I suppose Justice Ginsburg's point is relevant, though, on the question of prejudice. If the judge gets up there and says, I don't care what the government says, I am not going to give anybody a departure when they have committed another crime, then you haven't been prejudiced by the government's breach."},{"name":"JUSTICE ALITO","id":7,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Well, the judge would have known about what happened anyway from -- from the presentence investigation, wouldn't he?"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"But he could have, if he felt that way -- I mean, there they were in the courtroom; all of them knew about the plea agreement because there had been the Rule 11 colloquy when it was taken, right?"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"When the plea was taken - -"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"-- it was the same judge, wasn't it?"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"And so they were all there and the defendant was asked all these questions, and the government-- and the judge knew about the government's side of the plea bargain."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"So it was not a secret to anyone that the government said it would ask for the extra acceptance of responsibility credit. And yet the defendant and his lawyer stand there and they don't say a word: Wait a minute, judge. They didn't object at - - there was no motion to withdraw the plea, was there?"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"But - -"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Before the judge there was no plea to withdraw the plea."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"And so that's why we are -- if he had asked to withdraw the plea, then we'd have a different case. But he didn't, so we are here on plain-error review."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"But Santobello was a case where there was a timely objection."},{"name":"JUSTICE ALITO","id":7,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Why should that be the case? I know plea agreements are not strictly governed by contract law, but there is an analogy and your whole argument seems to be that the government's breach rendered the plea agreement void. But why would that so? There was a plea agreement, voluntarily entered into, and then there was a breach. So, why shouldn't the issue be what is the remedy for the breach? And why shouldn't it be governed by the plain-error rule like most errors that occur at trial?"},{"name":"JUSTICE ALITO","id":7,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"But you can say that in every case in which parties enter into a contract and later there is a breach. The fact that one of the parties later breaches doesn't mean that there never was a contract. There was an agreement that he voluntarily entered into at that time. And then there was a - - subsequently there was a breach, but that doesn't mean that he involuntarily -- he did not voluntarily enter into the agreement, does it?"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"What relief are you seeking now? You didn't -- you didn't ask to withdraw the plea when you were before the sentencing judge."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Right."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Which would expose him to a considerably greater penalty."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Why wouldn't it suffice to give your client everything that he was entitled to if the case were remanded to a different judge and the government were required to go before that judge and make the commitment that it undertook in the plea agreement?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Why wouldn't that be a perfectly satisfactory remedy?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Well, you have to say that. But let's assume I don't agree with that. Let's assume I agree with Justice Alito that his entry into it was voluntary and all that's happened is that one of the commitments on the part of one of the parties has not been complied with. Why isn't it an adequate remedy for that problem to send it back to a new judge and have the government come before that judge and make the same commitment it was supposed to under the agreement?"},{"name":"JUSTICE STEVENS","id":8,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"May I ask essentially two questions. You mentioned the fact that this is not - - this is an unusual agreement, and that some of the provisions were negotiated and the record shows they were -- they were deliberately undertaken. It seems to me that this was probably a scrivener's error. The normal -- most plea agreements would include a provision that if the defendant engaged in unlawful conduct, all bets are off. And my hunch was that somebody just forgot to put the boilerplate language in the agreement. Is that fair to say? I can't imagine the government negotiating an agreement that doesn't include that clause."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"It did include it in the motion, didn't they?"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Wasn't there a motion - -"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"-- for credit for acceptance of responsibility, and had as a condition that the defendant be law-abiding?"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"So isn't it odd that the -- that these documents both meant to serve the same purpose, one has the provision for law-abiding conduct in the future and the other doesn't?"},{"name":"JUSTICE STEVENS","id":8,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"But going back to my question, isn't it a likely explanation for the defendant's lawyer's failure to object that he just didn't realize this agreement didn't have this normal provision in it?"},{"name":"JUSTICE STEVENS","id":8,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Right."},{"name":"JUSTICE STEVENS","id":8,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"No, I understand that. But the other thing I wanted to ask you: You keep using the term \"void.\" Do our cases say that any breach of a plea agreement renders it void rather than subject to some kind of other remedy?"},{"name":"JUSTICE STEVENS","id":8,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"But those are cases that say that the remedy is setting aside the -- the guilty plea, but they don't characterize the -- the agreement as having become void, if I -- if I remember correctly."},{"name":"JUSTICE STEVENS","id":8,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Yes, but those -- that goes to the integrity of the guilty plea, not to whether or not the underlying contract became void, I think. Maybe I'm missing something."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"It doesn't -- it doesn't retroactively render the government's promise a misrepresentation. Every time a -- a party to a contract fails to comply with a contract, he hasn't been guilty of fraud. \"Misrepresentation\" would mean the government had no intention of complying with it when - - when it entered into it, and you -- you don't assert that was the case, do you?"},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":5,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Under the law of contracts I assume -- I haven't looked it up yet -- that you can't rescind for a nonmaterial breach. A trivial breach doesn't always allow recision. And isn't it trivial if the district court said: You know, I don't care if the Attorney General of the United States and the Solicitor General himself both came into the court on their hands and knees begging me to do this. I wouldn't do this. I wouldn't give you an increase."},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":5,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"So it seems to me an immaterial breach, other than as to one level -- and correct me if I am wrong. I take it as to level one - - or as to the third level, they need the recommendation before they have the authority to reduce. Am I right about that?"},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":5,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"There are some instances in which the -- the prosecution must make the recommendation before the district judge has the authority to depart downward, am I correct?"},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":5,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"That's right. So -- so this -- this district judge, I take it, did not have the authority to go down by -- by a third without the recommendation?"},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":5,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Even as to the third level, the district judge said, you know, I will assume that they have made the argument. I will assume they have made the argument. I wouldn't hear the -- I -- I wouldn't grant -- I wouldn't follow the recommendation. I am not going to depart downward even assuming the government -- it seems to me that there is -- the government's breach is immaterial."},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":5,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"My reading of Santobello is the same as yours on that point, and it's difficult for me to understand."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":3,"spokeBefore":5,"sideBefore":"justices","text":"There was part of this agreement that was honored. In fact, the judge after having said that, I never heard of giving credit for responsibility to somebody who commits a crime in the interim, but he said: I understand there was an agreement to sentence at the low end, and that's what I'm going to do."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"So if you say what you want is a trial, the defendant would be exposed to not just the upper level; plus weren't there add-ones in this case that the judge ordered to be served concurrently rather than consecutively?"},{"name":"JUSTICE ALITO","id":7,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"What would counsel say about a case in which it's unclear whether there is a breach? There is a factual dispute as to whether there was a breach. Let's say the government agrees that it will reserve the right to call all relevant facts to the attention of the sentencing judge, but won't take a position on sentencing. And the prosecutor in sentencing makes certain remarks that might be interpreted as taking a position or might be interpreted as simply calling facts to the judge's attention. Would it be your position that when a defendant hears that, the defendant can sit back and wait and see whether he or she is satisfied with the sentence and then after this sentence is imposed raise the issue of breach on appeal and not be subject to plain error, rather than calling it to the attention of the sentencing judge at the time when the -- the potential breach could be adjudicated?"},{"name":"JUSTICE ALITO","id":7,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"I'm not sure that really answers my question."},{"name":"JUSTICE ALITO","id":7,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Are you saying as to some errors there is a plain-error rule, in some breaches there is a plain-error rule, but not as to all breaches?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"So you are saying, if -- if I understand you correctly, that even if at the trial your client's lawyer had objected and had -- and had said, Your Honor, the government promised to recommend, you know, a lower thing, what the trial judge would have to have said was, the plea agreement is invalid. And the trial judge could not say, oh, yes, the government has to make that recommendation. You are -- you are saying it is invalidated by the mere fact of the government's not having done it, right?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"So no objection need to be made or can be made, right?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Wow."},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":5,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Well, but I take it -- you never really answered Justice Alito's question. I take it that the defendant and his counsel can knowingly recognize that an error is being committed, say nothing, listen to the sentence, and then object later. That's your position, yes or no?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Well, that's inconsistent with the answer you gave me."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"The answer you gave me is that automatically the guilty plea is washed out - - automatically."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"It is automatically washed out?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"And, therefore, he cannot -- he cannot sit around and wait to see what happens. What happens is -- whatever happens, it's invalid. The plea agreement is no good. You have to have a new trial."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Voidable -- then your answer to me would be different. It's -- it's not void. It's voidable, so that he can play dog in the manger and wait and see what happens, and then if it's in interest that -- in his interest to void it, he does. If it's in his interest not to void it, he doesn't."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"It would not be cost-free for you, because if you just sit there and say, you know, the agreement is void, the government is going to say, well, fine, I will see you in court; and we will have a trial; and you are going to get twice as much as you would have gotten anyway. You have some interest, since you entered the guilty plea, in going forward with the plea."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Well, but let's put it this way. Maybe this is the same question anyway. Let's say it is the same facts as we have here but instead of saying, I can't do this, the judge says, I'm going to do this. And, look, I think you are remorseful. I'm going to give you three points. And that's all you agreed with the government. The government says we'll recommend it, and the judge says, well, you're going to get it anyway. I think you should get it. The agreement has still been breached, right? The government didn't recommend."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"So in that situation, you think you can withdraw the agreement?"},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Well - -"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":6,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"justices","text":"But why -- why should the defendant have the option to withdraw from an agreement when he got everything under the best possible circumstances that he could have expected?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":6,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"No, but we are talking about the Chief Justice's hypothetical at this point. And they -- in his hypothetical, the sentencing judge says, I'm going to give you the three points; you are going to get everything that on the rosiest scenario you could have hoped for. Why should he be able to withdraw his plea at that point?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":6,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"In other words, your position is -- is kind of a theoretical formalistic position, that -- I'm not sure if this is the wrong words here -- there is a metaphysical quality to the plea, and even though things turn out as well to him as he could possibly have expected had the agreement been kept punctiliously, if the government simply omits the words he can walk away from the plea? I mean, that's your position?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":6,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Yes, but usually -- I mean, the theory of relief in contract law depends upon relief from something. And if, in fact, there is -- there is no discernible damage that has been suffered, if on the other hand -- again, taking the Chief's hypothetical - - there is an affirmative demonstration that no damage occurred, normal principles of contract would say there is nothing to give him relief from. The law of contract is -- is not a metaphysical construct. Why should the law of plea agreements be?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":6,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Well, I think you are. I mean, you are saying even though he has come out with, you know, a rose in his mouth, he can still, if he is crazy enough, throw away the whole plea agreement."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":6,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"What I'm getting at -- I think what we are all trying to get at -- is in order to have a rule, an absolute rule like yours, we usually look for a good reason to have that rule. And since we are talking about an agreement, the place to look for the good reason is in the consequences to the defendant. And when the consequences are terrific, when they are the best that he could possibly have hoped for, there doesn't seem to be a good reason to adopt your very theoretical construct of agreement. Is there some reason that we are just not seeing?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":6,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Never mind what the government can cite. I'm asking you if there is a good reason to adopt this absolute rule of yours."},{"name":"JUSTICE STEVENS","id":8,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"May I ask this kind of conceptual question? Is it your view that a breach of a plea agreement can never be concluded to be harmless error?"},{"name":"JUSTICE STEVENS","id":8,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"I'm trying to get rid of the labels like \"plain error\" and \"structural.\" But if in fact it's totally harmless and everybody agrees it's harmless, would the government still have to -- or would there be an adverse consequence nevertheless?"},{"name":"JUSTICE STEVENS","id":8,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"So, there could never be harmless error, harmless breach of a plea agreement?"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Why wouldn't someone read what happened here as the defendant saying, well, I didn't get the acceptance credit, but the judge is still sentencing me at the low end, and he's still making the sentences run concurrently, so I think -- why, if he doesn't try to withdraw the plea, why isn't it the logical assumption that he says I didn't get the whole promise but I got part of it, and I'll take it?"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"How do we know this one didn't?"},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Thank you, counsel.

And then the judge says -- and we are not going to move for the recommendation. And the judge says: I will assume that you made the recommendation, and I will just tell you right now I wouldn't take the recommendation anyway. I'm not going -- I wouldn't give a lowered sentence even if you made the objection. What result?"},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":5,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Is it?

Can you distinguish Santobello on that basis?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":6,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Excuse me, were you -- Justice Kennedy, were you through? I'm sorry, I thought you started a question again. The problem I have with the harmless error suggestion that you've made is this. If the government does engage in some breach of the agreement, it seems to me the consequence is that an individual has given up a trial and as a consequence of that has given up liberty, without either the trial that he is entitled to or fulfillment of the conditions for giving up the liberty. And isn't there -- isn't there a very high value to be placed on the fact that nobody in the United States under the constitutional guarantees should be - - should be sitting behind bars without either a conviction following full trial, invocation of whatever rights he wants to invoke, or a voluntary agreement to be behind bars? And -- and when neither of those conditions is fulfilled, don't we have an error that as a matter of constitutional law cannot be regarded as harmless."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":6,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"I -- I think I would agree with you there because, by whatever means, the defendant has gotten everything the defendant bargained for."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":6,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"It may have come by a more circuitous route, but he got it all."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":6,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"But in the case when, unlike the Chief Justice's hypothetical, when we don't know that, when we -- the judge sort of keeps his thoughts to himself or herself, then don't we have the -- the problem of the -- the individual behind bars, neither as a result of trial nor as a result of the deal that he made?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":6,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Doesn't -- whether we accept that proposition or not that the analysis must differ, doesn't that really depend on -- on what value we place on the importance of the proposition that I started with? If somebody's behind bars, it's either as a result of a valid conviction after trial or a voluntary agreement that says, yeah, I will stay there. And if -- if we place a very high value on the liberty interest -- in -- in retaining liberty except under those two conditions, then isn't it fair to us -- isn't it sensible for us to say even in a plain-error situation, we are going to recognize this -- this kind of prejudice, despite the fact that he didn't object? If we place a high value on the liberty interest, we wouldn't accept your position; isn't that fair?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":6,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"You are right, there is no question about it. If -- we are saying we will take a -- a less efficient process, a process less efficient perhaps even for getting at the truth, because we think the liberty interest is that important. You are entirely right."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":6,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Will you give me an example?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":6,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"No -- no question, but it seems to me that the answer to that is, it's an incentive that would never come into play if the government kept its word."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":6,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"So why -- why should -- why is the government really in a position to object to that?"},{"name":"JUSTICE STEVENS","id":8,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"You're talking about manipulation of the system.

I think here the real question is whether there's harmless error available, rather than turning anything on whether or not an objection was made in the district court."},{"name":"JUSTICE STEVENS","id":8,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"But in talking about the division of the circuits, do you think all breaches of -- of plea agreements should be governed by precisely the same standard?

So you can't really say that he wouldn't have done this or he certainly wouldn't have considered it. It's one thing to say I've never heard of that. It's another thing when one of your colleagues is there saying, this is what you should do."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Yeah, but none of us can know what the judge would have done. I mean, we have had cases here where the government's recommendation of downward departures has been pretty surprising to me as well, and it's because they were informants or whatever and they have engaged in some pretty bad conduct; and I don't know what Judge Sanders would have done."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":9,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Looking at this, why can't we say the following? Some circuits have said that they will never recognize plain error, when it's a breach of a plea agreement. That's wrong. It could be plain error like any other kind of a case, every other kind of issue. Sure. But the error here isn't plain. On the one hand, all they did, the promise was the government agreed to request that his sentence be placed at the lowest end, and they followed it. In the other part they made no promise. They simply agreed that he had demonstrated acceptance of responsibility. And then what they did at the trial, they said, \"we don't want him to get acceptance of responsibility at this point.\" Now, some people could argue that here is an implicit promise in paragraph 1, not to say something at the trial that is contrary to their recognition in paragraph 8. That's where it is. On the other hand, you could argue that there is implicit, also, a promise not to implicitly do the first implicit, if what he has done in the meantime is commit another serious crime. So we have two arguments, one of which says they committed error, and one of which says they didn't commit error; and the argument turns on two implicit readings of paragraph 8. Therefore, it is not plain. End of case. What's wrong with that?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":9,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Well, I mean, the government would like a whole lot of questions answered. So what I don't see is how the government can come here because they want a lot of questions answered, and get us to take the case, which I'm not sure was a wonderful idea; maybe it was. But then we take the case, and now they want us to say, no, no, don't take the obvious response to it because we would like you to answer five other questions. So what I want to know is, what's wrong with what I said? Is that a possible outcome?"},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"I may have gotten lost in the dialogue. As you understand it, Justice Breyer's suggestion was that you win, right? You get plain error, and then sometimes you apply it and it comes out one way, and sometimes you apply it the other."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"So you are happy to go along that."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"But that's a big difference, right? As you said earlier, harmless error, the government has the burden; plain error, the defendant has the burden. That's certainly going to change how you approach however many different factual contexts."},{"name":"JUSTICE STEVENS","id":8,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"It seems to me that the government has tried to pick a case in which it has the strongest opportunity to win on the merits in order to have us decide a rule that really isn't important in a lot of other cases, but it is totally unimportant in this case."},{"name":"JUSTICE STEVENS","id":8,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"But don't you think it would have been open to the government to make the argument that Justice Breyer has made and said there really wasn't a breach here, at least an insignificant breach that should be ignored?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":9,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"They can only get -- they can only get your breach if they find an implicit agreement. The implicit agreement is that you will not tell the court that, in light of changes, paragraph 8 no longer describes the situation. You didn't breach paragraph 8, as taken literally. You agree he had shown that acceptance of responsibility. What you told the court was, now we don't think he should have this acceptance of responsibility, which previously he had shown, because he's committed another crime. Those are the exact words you said to the court. Now, he may have made an implicit not to do that. On the other hand, that implicit promise may be negative by, you know, the other implicit acceptance of the fact that this applies only where we don't commit another crime. So I'm just saying this -- I'm not saying you are even right. I'm just saying, having those two arguments, it seems that you aren't plainly wrong. You aren't plainly wrong. So how do I get to the other questions if I believe that? Do I say, \"Hypothetically if the error here were plain, which I think it isn't, then I'd like to tell you where the burden of proof lies.\"? By the way, if I happened to think that that's whatever it is, then I will go into a few other things. That's really what I feel you are asking me to do because I don't think it's plain. Maybe the other people think it's plain."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":4,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"I think it's plain. What about paragraph 9?

It doesn't mean I will not do it again.

You are supposed to go there and say, \"Look, we agreed to recommend it and we do recommend it.\" You could say, \"And by the way, you should know that he's gone out and done this again.\" But you most -- you certainly prejudiced him by not doing what you said you would do."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"No, but isn't it the fact that we can never know what Judge Sanders would have done if the government had what it said it would do.

At the time we entered into it, we made that undertaking.\" And so then everybody is sure that the judge's mind is focused on that. Wouldn't that be the better practice?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":6,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Well, could the breach have been cured? I mean, the point -- it seems to me, the point at which the defendant would have known that the government had breached the agreement was when the government stood there before the court and said, \"In fact, he hasn't accepted responsibility. He went out and committed another crime while he was behind bars.\" It seems to me that that's the point -- and maybe this phrase occurred somewhere in the record - - that that's a bell that you can't unring. For the defendant to get up and object and said, \"Wait a minute, were you supposed to represent to the court that you agreed that I did accept responsibility\" -- to require the government to fulfill that undertaking at that point would have been ridiculous. I suppose the U.S. attorney could have said, \"Oh, yes, he's right, Judge. We agreed that he accepted responsibility.\" But the U.S. attorney has already just said a moment before, \"He hasn't. We really don't mean that at all.\" There's no way, it seems to me, that there could have been a better outcome in a case like this, even if the objection had been contemporary."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":6,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Which would have been silly."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":3,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"It was sent to another judge, that judge would still have the presentence report.

And then the judge turns to the probation officer, and the probation officer says, just to reiterate what Ms. Simms said, the new offense, according to the guidelines of the guideline manual, prohibits any acceptance of responsibility.
