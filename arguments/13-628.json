He thinks it is our policy not to recognize Jerusalem as the capital, which you apparently agree with, and he thinks that this does have some tendency at least to suggest the contrary. Now, I'm a judge. I'm not a foreign affairs expert.

For that matter, if you are an American citizen born in Jerusalem today, you can't get the rights to say Palestine. This is a very selective vanity plate law, if we might call it that. And -- and it's selective because Congress had, it appears to me, and it's consistent with the rest of the statute, as Justice Ginsburg said, a real view that this was the self-identification it wanted. In other words, the ability of American citizens to say yes, I was born in Jerusalem, and that means I was born in Israel.

Now, suppose the State Department, and I think this is its position, says this is recognition. If we defer to the State Department's judgment, to the government's executive judgment on that point, and the government said this is recognition, and you say it isn't recognition, why doesn't the government trump? If the government -- if the Congress really wants to test its power, it can pass a law saying you must recognize Israel as being the legitimate government of Palestine, but it has not done that.

And so I guess I have to sort of say that that answer that you gave me, that this could -- that Congress could say to the Secretary of State, here's the diplomatic communication that you have to send to other foreign ministers, seems, well, a little bit shocking."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"So you would say in Justice Kagan's hypothetical, maybe the letter that's required to be sent to every foreign head of state would be unconstitutional, but that doesn't mean that the passport is, because the passport is used primarily for purposes of identification, and it's only the letter that makes it something else."},{"name":"JUSTICE KAGAN","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Well, if you say that --"},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"spokeBefore":4,"sideBefore":"justices","text":"Justice Kennedy."},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":3,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"justices","text":"Do you want us to say in our opinion that this is not a political declaration?"},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Well, then, I'm not sure why that Congress passed it, then."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":5,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"I thought it was a Federal crime to say that you were born in the United States when you weren't on an official document.

That's what -- that's the -- you know, the Secretary of State requests all of these who are going to be looking at this passport. And then in Haig v. Agee, we described a passport as a letter of introduction in which the issuing sovereign vouches for the bearer and requests other sovereigns to aid the bearer.
