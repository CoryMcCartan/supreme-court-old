It seems to me that it's a bit of a slippery slope if you start saying we're going to look at what the class could -- could recover in deciding whether or not, not simply whether or not this representative is adequate, but whether or not it's below or above, above or below $5 million."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Yes, but under the traditional -- you surely don't want us to apply the rules of the traditional diversity statute to this case because it's clear that under the traditional diversity statute, you -- you can waive excessive damages, right?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"So you don't want us to apply that rule here."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Well, why doesn't -- why doesn't the normal class certification process protect adequately the absent class members?

My point is that much of your argument in your brief is centered around binding the absent class members.  What I'm getting to is that if the stipulation is grossly unfair, there may not be a class at all, or the Plaintiffs who have claims greater than those in the aggregate might opt -- will get notice and opt out. And there is due process challenges if a settlement is entered that is so grossly unfair that it violates due process.

It got -- it really -- it raised the matter in controversy threshold.  It eliminated the Zahn anti-aggregation rule.  It eliminated the complete diversity requirement.  It eliminated the one-year limit on removal. Here's one thing it didn't eliminate.  It didn't eliminate the St. Paul master of your complaint rule.

It doesn't deal with this question of amount in controversy.  However, the individual, the named plaintiff, who has said, I'm not going to seek more than the $5 million, cannot speak for the members of the class who are absent.  He can't stipulate that they will take under 5,000. I thought that was the central part of your argument, not based on the statute itself, but on the notion that a named plaintiff, unless and until he is -- he is certified to represent the class - doesn't represent them. He can represent himself, but he can't bind the people who -- who have not been certified as part of a class.  I thought that was part of your argument."},{"name":"JUSTICE KAGAN","id":5,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"But he doesn't have power to affect those claims before the certification has happened."},{"name":"JUSTICE KAGAN","id":5,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Before the certification has happened, they can do whatever they want.

I was looking at the words of the statute. And if I look at 1332, which has been on the books a long time, it says, \"The district court shall have original jurisdiction of all civil actions where the matter in controversy exceeds the sum or value of $75,000, exclusive of interest, of costs, and\" -- et cetera, okay? Then I look here, and it says, \"The district court shall have jurisdiction of any civil action in which the manner in controversy exceeds the sum or value of $5 million, exclusive of interest and costs,\" et cetera, okay?  So the words seem identical. Now, in respect to the first, we know that a lawyer can file a binding stipulation that says, I don't care what this is about, I am not asking for more than $75,000, and the Federal court does not have jurisdiction.  Given that's true in the first statute, and given that the second statute is almost identically worded, at least in that part, why can't he do the same thing with the $5 million? And it can't be the words I quoted that stopped him from doing it, so what is the word that stops him from doing it?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":7,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Yes, as to what that looks like, \"shall be aggregated,\" again from the language, is it's simply to make certain that Zahn does not require the individual -- thing to approach -- to count.  In other words, you aggregate rather than just looking at the individual members, which is Zahn, which has nothing to do with the issue before us."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":7,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"No, they rarely pass a statute that says, let's just get rid of case X. Normally they look to the holding of case X, and then they pass the statute that says the opposite.  So the holding of Zahn was that you could not aggregate the individual members' claims in a class.  So to get rid of Zahn, what we do is we pass a statute that says you can aggregate. And indeed, nobody objects here to the aggregation.  It's the total amount of the claims being limited by a stipulation that is the issue here, and that's why I had trouble finding your argument in the word \"aggregation.\""},{"name":"JUSTICE KAGAN","id":5,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Mr. Boutrous, that form of argument -- Congress could have said -- does seem to me to be much worse for your position.  If Congress had wanted to get rid of the St. Paul master of your complaint rule, it could have said, we are getting rid of the St. Paul master of your complaint rule.

But he gets to decide whether to seek damages.  He gets -- at all, or whether he only can seek injunctive relief.  He gets to decide which claims to bring, trespass or negligence.  He gets to decide how many years' worth to ask for.  He gets to decide which defendants to sue. All of these things are going to have an effect on -- on the amount that's -- that's being asked for.

We're not going to allow you to do that.  You're not an adequate representative. On the other hand, in a case like this where it's $5,024,000 and it only gets there because you've added on one and a half million dollars of legal fees, the Court might very well say you are an adequate representative, go for it.

But you inform people, unlike Justice Alito, you figure a way around his problem, you keep them informed, and you say, it's getting close, getting close. And once you are up to $4,800,000, the others get the word:  Stay out of it.  And once they stay out of it, you go ahead with your action and then those that stayed out of it becomes the subject of a second action.  And if it's for 50 million, then you have ten actions and then you have 20.  So, in fact, all that is required is a few extra pieces of paper that will soon become standardized, and a lot of postage stamps. And we have 30 or 40 or $50 million cases being tried in whatever counties Congress liked the least.  I gather they're some in Arkansas.

Here, we are told that the real amount is only slightly above the $5 million figure, but I don't think that makes any difference.

And what we're going to do is we will divide our $25 million class action into six subsidiary actions and proceed exactly the same merry way.  And we do that by means of stipulation. Now, your words in the statute do favor that, in my opinion, at the moment.  But the purpose seems to strongly cut the other way.  And I do see a way to go the other way, in that you could say, given the purpose of this, the words do mean something different, and they do mean you should aggregate the real value of the real amounts that the class is likely to have. Now, it's capable of that reading, and the virtue of that reading is that it would stop what looks like, from what you're saying, a mechanical method of avoiding the purpose of the statute.
