I'm -- I -- I don't quite see -- if you would discuss it a little bit -- how you do this as a matter of constitutional law, because the Due Process Clause is tied to fundamental unfairness, and I think the answer has to be in this kind of circumstance, secret block or not, it depends. It depends on many things. So, would you write this as a matter of constitutional law? Would it -- shouldn't it be written as a matter of Federal common law of contracts? Shouldn't it be written as an exposition of the superior knowledge doctrine, which seems totally open to it? And -- or shouldn't it be written as a matter of discovery law, which is what the district judge who ended up thinking -- the Court of Claims judge says, gee, I don't really know. I mean, that's how I read it. How would you -- would you speak about this for a minute?GENERAL KATYAL: Sure. Justice Breyer, I think that due process is an ill-fitting concept in this contractual dispute for a couple of reasons. Not just can the sophisticated parties agree ahead of time to other things, but also the whole notion of due process in contracts is odd, because the government has waived its sovereign immunity only since 1855. They don't have any freestanding right to come in ab initio and claim fundamental fairness on contracts. I think that is implicit in the Constitution itself, that they don't have that right. And so, the question becomes, is there some extra protection the courts should give here akin to the one in Reynolds about criminal defendants in the government using state-secrets information? And I think the answer to that is \"no,\" because parties can work that out themselves ex ante. And so, my answer to you is -- I think it was option B -- to use the contract as the -- and contractual interpretation as the basic rule for a decision here. The contract itself specified -- and it was done under the shadow of Reynolds and under the shadow of -- of Totten that specified that they would have to be the moving party.
