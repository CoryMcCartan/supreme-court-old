Were there any?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":6,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Counsel, I -- I -- having read some of those cases that you've cited that you claim weakened or eliminated the burden of proof standard, most of them didn't quite eliminate it. Virtually all of them added an instruction to the jury of some sort that said that the application of the standard should take into account the fact that the PTO did not consider evidence -- did not consider the prior art relied upon in the invalidity challenge. You didn't ask for such an instruction in this case; is that correct? And if you didn't, why isn't that adequate to convey the point that you're trying to convey, that a jury should, in fact, consider that the PTO never got to see that prior art?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":6,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"But other judges give a slightly different standard.

I'll assume that the language is open enough in the history so that we could make what would be a change, I think it would be a change. The reasons as I get from the brief for doing that are because there are two types of errors: It's a bad thing not to give protection to an invention that deserves it; and it is just as bad a thing to give protection to an invention that doesn't deserve it. Both can seriously harm the economy. And you are also saying that the Patent Office is out of control, not through its own fault, but there are too few people and too many inventions. And therefore type two error is a real risk. So I'm turning you to and say: Well, what should we do about it? I know your proposal. But we have also seen in these briefs the following proposal: One, somebody who thinks there is a type two error, go back to the Patent Office and ask for reconsideration. That's pretty good. We get the experts to look at it again. And then that's coupled with: Tell the district judges to stick very closely to their job, allow the clear and convincing standard to apply to facts, and by that we mean brute facts, and let them decide the brute facts, but let the judge decide whether that amounts to obviousness, novelty, or any of the other prerequisites. Now, I've gotten that out of the amicus briefs, some of which say they support you but they really don't. So I would like -- I would like your views on those two suggestions as being sufficient to cure the problem that you point to."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":7,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"I'm getting that out of the American Intellectual Property Law Association. I don't blame them for my phrasing of it, but that is what struck the thought in my mind that careful instructions limiting the juries to brute facts and giving the judge the notion, the job of characterizing that -- you heard what I said -- that that will go a long way towards curing the problem you're worried about."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":7,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"It might not in your situation. But the problem is in principle as it's put to us that the office and the Federal Circuit emerge giving protection to things that aren't really novel, that aren't really advances on the prior art, et cetera. Now, if that's the problem, and you carefully instruct the jury, the bad fake patents will go away because the judge will say: Look, this metal case called a battery leakproof is not really novel."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":7,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"No, no. The judge says: want you to find if this metal container is leak proof. Jury: Yes. Now it's up to the judge."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Mr. Hungar, could we go back to the statute that was enacted in 1952. Before that the burden of proof on the issue of validity of the patent or the effect of the patent, that was on the challenger. So when Congress added a presumption of validity, it must have had in mind something more than the defendant would have the burden of proof and the normal standard is preponderance. So by adding a presumption of validity, must Congress have intended to do something more than simply repeat that the defendant has the burden of proof?"},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":8,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Burden of going forward or burden of persuasion?"},{"name":"JUSTICE ALITO","id":9,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"If the challenger has the burden of persuasion, wouldn't it almost go without saying that the challenger would also have the burden of production on the issue of invalidity?

First, the statute says the burden of establishing invalidity of a patent, et cetera, et cetera, shall rest on the parties asserting such invalidity. If Congress wanted to impose a clear and convincing burden, why in the world would they not have said that expressly in that sentence? Number two, if the first sentence, \"a patent shall be presumed valid,\" means that -- is talking about the burden, then it's superfluous, because that's dealt with in the second sentence. And, third, the phrase \"shall be presumed valid\" doesn't seem to me at all to suggest clear and convincing evidence. A presumption normally doesn't have anything to do with clear and convincing evidence. Most presumptions can be disproved by much less than clear and convincing evidence. So how do you read that in -- your -- your position into the language of the statute?"},{"name":"JUSTICE ALITO","id":9,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"I've gotten a lot smarter since then.
