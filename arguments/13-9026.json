And a few feet sounds, yeah, it sounds substantial to me.   I know nothing about it, you see. So is there anything else you want to say in Alderson Reporting Company response to what Justice Alito said?   Because that -- think of my problem.   It's not your client that is the problem, but it's not the main problem.   The main problem is to write a standard so people can understand it.

You have a number of factors.

Now, that could depend on lots of things, not just the distance traveled.   So to -- applying a Alderson Reporting Company purely spatial test to that just doesn't make any sense.

That is what I have a problem with."},{"name":"JUSTICE ALITO","id":5,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"What is the reason for this?

It thinks about a particular case, it has an idea in its mind of the sort of conduct that they mean, which is this John Dillinger example, but then when it gets down to drafting the words it writes words that are broader than that, that include things that are not in Alderson Reporting Company the front of their minds, like this one."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":8,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"But here it wasn't a single step.

"},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Yes, but all the definitions begin by saying accompanying is go with somebody as an associate or companion.   Yes, it is certainly a permissible use and a common use in context to say I accompanied someone â€“you know - across the hall. But when you are in the context that this present one is of bank robbery, the point of associate or companion, I think, takes on greater weight.   Obviously, an unwilling one."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"All right, you take two bank robberies.   One, the robber comes in, waves a gun, pistol whips five people, grabs the money and leaves.   Okay?  In another the bank robber comes in, just gets the bag of money, says, you walk over here 2 feet with me, so he can get the bag of money and leaves. The first one you could get probation.   I mean, you're not going to, but there's no minimum sentence.   And the second one you get at least 10 years.   That doesn't make any sense."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"But they didn't care exactly what the minimum was, right, even before the sentencing guidelines, which would obviously have a higher sentence, they didn't care if it was one year because of extenuating circumstances, whatever.   But, they said, forcing someone to accompany you is so much more serious that you get at least 10 years."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Range where?"},{"name":"JUSTICE KAGAN","id":6,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Do you think there's --"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":9,"spokeBefore":6,"sideBefore":"justices","text":"The problem -- the problem is there is a set of cases where you can think it's serious and a set of cases where you just think it isn't.   The bank robbery -- there are more in the bank are the ones that concern me that it isn't.   The bank robbers are in the bank, there are a couple of other customers walk in and one of them says will you please walk over here with me for a second.   Okay?  They walk two feet to get him out of the way.   That doesn't sound as if that is a lot worse than pistol whipping somebody. And you can multiply those cases. And what is worrying me about it is, since it's a mandatory minimum, the prosecutors have a choice about whether to -- to indict or not on that ground, and a person who is coming in and who is represented and -- Alderson Reporting Company what is his choice? You know, you either plead guilty or I put this in, too, because you moved one of the customers 10 feet. Now, that's -- that's the -- it's the -- that's the nature of the mandatory minimum which is disturbing and calls, I think, for some kind of lenity when there is openness of interpretation. But on the other hand it's very hard for me to distinguish how to separate the cases that seem comparatively trivial taking place within the bank from the ones where you really are injecting fear, special fear, into the mind of the person who is told to accompany you, and that could take place even if it's like one foot, because he's been singled out. Okay. Is there any way to do it? Is there any way that you could reassure me that in these lesser cases this will not be used as an instrument towards a guilty plea or an instrument where these minor things that he's been talking about nonstop, your brother over here, that they'll certainly turn out to be charged routinely?"},{"name":"JUSTICE KAGAN","id":6,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"But that's what you are going to lead it to, Mr. Fletcher, it's just going to be prosecutorial good judgment that's going to separate the case that's, like, could you come with me a couple of feet."},{"name":"JUSTICE KAGAN","id":6,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Right.

(Laughter.)"},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"spokeBefore":9,"sideBefore":"justices","text":"But the point is the idea of someone whose bank is being robbed not being forcibly compelled to accompany someone is fanciful, and all you have to do, again -- I guess it's repeating the question -- is you got two feet and the prosecutor is armed with another 10 years automatically in his pocket, and then you use that to extort a plea bargain of, you know, six years, somebody who might otherwise wanted to go to trial."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Well, that begs the question, I think."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Well, your U.S. attorney's manual does just that.

Say that what this statute covers is forcible abduction, and there we are. That's not perfect.

Why not just pick up those words and say indeed, the government uses that when it explains it."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"So the manual is read -- forcibly abducts, they read as for somebody to move two feet.   That's an abduction?"},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"And so the manual which -- the other provision in the manual which is that you should charge as large an offense as possible means that in the case where somebody is forced to move two feet, you charge the -- that as a forcible abduction."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"So is two feet consistent with the conduct at issue?"},{"name":"JUSTICE KAGAN","id":6,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"When Congress first drafted this accompanying language, this was a capital offense, yes?"},{"name":"JUSTICE KAGAN","id":6,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"So, I mean, would you say the same thing if it were still a capital offense?
