So, therefore, the sentence that jumps out the page here was where the court of appeals says that Rule 403's exclusion is an extraordinary remedy that should be sparingly -- used sparingly. Is that a general rule? Because my impression was -- and this is why I asked you as a trial lawyer -- is that if you take 401 and 402 and read them literally, we'll have trials that last a thousand years. And, really, the way a trial judge keeps the trial under control is to say: Well, maybe there is some slight tendency here to make a fact more likely than not; but, even if that's so, this is a waste of time. And I thought that kind of decision is what trial judges are there to make."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":8,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"And, therefore, I thought this court of appeals is trying to second-guess that trial court judge unless that trial court judge is making an absolute rule, which he may have been.

Now, I would appreciate your response to that."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":8,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Well, then, how are we going to -- I'm not arguing about what it says so much as I'm arguing about who has the right between the court of appeals and the trial court to decide?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":8,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"And all I'm worried about -- and you tell me if that's the law in the Tenth Circuit or elsewhere.

I assume the company can call the other 995 and say: Are there any allegations against you? Did you fire people? And did you in some cases keep the oldest one?
