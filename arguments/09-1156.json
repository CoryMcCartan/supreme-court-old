And it sells this product to many, many, many hundreds of thousands of people. And most of them use this product with no adverse effect whatsoever, but there are 10 cases where somebody uses this product and they go blind. Three of those 10 cases -- the person had to borrow a contact lens from a friend, only used it in the one eye; they go blind only in that one eye. This is not statistically significant.

Or the judge after you get some evidence on it? Or the jury? And the same is true of scienter, after all, because the scienter, you see -- and you have to plead that with particularity. Okay.

And they say we also have 25 people who were hurt and some burning sensations in people where it didn't rise to that level. You know, I don't know. I don't know if that's within the range of expectation of drug companies as part of the normal course of business which investors should know about, and I suspect a district judge doesn't know, either.

That's the question presented. Justice Kagan started with the point that the FDA doesn't require that. It requires just reasonable evidence of a connection, not statistical. Many of the amici here have done a wonderful job of explaining why statistical importance can't be a measure because it depends on the nature of the study at issue. So given all of that -- and even in your brief, in a footnote, you answered the question by saying no, we can't establish that rule as an absolute, because there are additional factors that could prove materiality and scienter. So you've already answered the question presented. Are we down to what Justice Scalia asked you, which is: We've got a \"no\" to the question: Are the facts in this case enough? I don't know why we would have granted cert on that, but you presented a different question presented. Given the question presented, is the answer no?
