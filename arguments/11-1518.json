So what, in addition to being unauthorized and self-dealing, which the government tells us should be enough to make defalcation, what else other than that it was not  authorized and it was self-dealing?"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":5,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"But is a trustee who is taking -- borrowing against the cash value of the life insurance making an investment for the benefit of himself and his mother getting profit from that investment and not sharing it with the other siblings who are also.

That's not at all unusual."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":6,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Their preference is that they wanted a piece of the action.  They still do.  They want the profits from that investment.

Or is that clear from the record."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":8,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Could -- could you go back, please, to Justice Alito's question?  I -- I don't understand the answer to that.  That is, I don't understand, and it's just something I don't understand. I'm not saying it facetiously.  I don't understand the relationship of mental state to the issue. I mean, I didn't think there is any doubt here that the individual, your client, knew what he was doing.  He knew for a fact that he was taking money from the trust.  He knew he was giving it to his mother.  And he knows where it's going.  And he knows it was later paid back with 6 percent interest.  So you don't have to assume extreme recklessness.  He knew it. Now, what he didn't know was that that was unlawful.  And therefore, if I look at the accompanying things, embezzlement, larceny, fraud in the trust, I don't think any of them require a knowledge that what you're doing is unlawful. So if I -- or do they?  I don't think -- you can be convicted of embezzlement while misunderstanding the law of embezzlement. You can be convicted of larceny, it's saying.  And as far as I know, a person to commit fraud lies, knows it's material, knows, et cetera, but he doesn't have to know there's a law against it.  And --  and so -- if I do what Justice Harlan was doing and comparing it to the other three, it looks as if you don't need to know that what you're doing is against the law, where you commit defalcation. Now, that I think is what Justice Alito was driving at.  And I'd like to hear an absolutely clear answer on that."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":8,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"But I didn't think there's any respect here in which admissing -- mistake of law, would negate the mental state as to having taken money from the trust, used it in the family business and then paid it back, which I take it are, we assume, which is a different question I have, but for present purposes, we are assuming that that's sufficient for defalcation. Is that right?  Where does it, where does it negative the intent in respect to what happened?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":8,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"No, it had nothing to do with recklessness.  He did these three things knowingly. That is a stronger mental state than recklessness, not a weaker one."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":8,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Were unlawful.  So we're back at the same question, and I'm now assuming you have no answer to the question because there is none."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":6,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"My problem is the following, which is let's assume he had taken the money and lost it and he never repaid it.  What does it matter whether he thought he could take the money or not?  I thought the very basic definition of defalcation in every dictionary of the time and forever, one of the three definitions has always been that you cause a loss to the -- to the trust.  Why does mental state matter at all, is my bottom line?  I think that your stronger argument is that loss to the estate, or the one that you have to -- can direct your attention to, is what is the loss to the trust?  But what does it matter whether I intended to lose it or not if I wasn't entitled to lose it?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":6,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Well, that's Justice Breyer's point, which is if you took the money and lost it, what does it matter?  You took it.  Unless -- unless you were drugged and didn't know that you were taking the money and somebody else forced you to in some -- under some sort of duress defense, some outrageous question, isn't the issue the one that Justice Breyer came to?  If you're a fiduciary, why should an excuse of ignorance of the law ever save you when you are required to exercise the highest protection of the trust?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":6,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Why should you be discharged if you took -- if you knowingly did an act,  the actus reus --"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":6,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"-- with its concomitant mental state.  You intended to take the money."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":8,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Yes, but you see -- should I have to write the opinion in this case, I would have to deal with this issue and I'd have to say something about it.  And as soon as I look at the other words, those are words like \"embezzlement,\" \"larceny,\" and \"fraud.\"  Now, elsewhere in the U.S. Code where those are crimes ignorance of the law is not an excuse.  It often is an excuse where in fact it's a tax violation or some other technical violation. So I would have to explain why the word \"defalcation\" when linked to those three is being treated differently.  Or I'd have to say Congress used  words which never have ignorance of the law as an excuse and meant them differently.  Each of those is pretty hard to say."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":8,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"I have one other question on a different subject that may be more helpful to you or not.  I think of defalcation as the individual who has defalcated shows up in Rio with two suitcases full of money, and it seems to me if you look at the root of the word, it consists of diminishing, taking a sickle and cutting something down, and therefore it did seem to refer to an instance where you take the corpus or money belonging to the trust, now it becomes ambiguous, and you run off with it. Is there anything you would like to say  about that?"},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"But there is a shortage of accounts at the end of the day.  It's just a question of what day it is.  When he takes -- takes the stuff and it's a lost -- it's either viewed as a lost opportunity or an increase in the risk to the beneficiary, and that's a loss to them at that point. The fact -- it's like a bank robber giving back the money.  There is no loss to the bank, but it's still a crime."},{"name":"JUSTICE KAGAN","id":9,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"But I guess the question is how do you measure this loss?  I mean, if you take money away and then you give it back, or even if you give it back with 2 percent interest or something, I mean, maybe if that money had remained in the trust and I realize that this is a strange trust, but we have to think about other kinds of trusts, if that money had remained in the  trust, there would have been a profit to be made from that money. And -- you know, it's not -- if you say, well, I gave it back, well, yes, but if you had just left it there, you would have had that money plus all the money that that money earned."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":5,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"But what -- what about the profit from the transactions, the profit that he made?  Yes, he paid back everything with interest, but in addition to that, according to the Illinois court's judgment, there was a profit that he made that he didn't put back in the trust -- he didn't put in the trust."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":10,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"A quarter of a million dollars in loans."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":10,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"And that did not go back  into the trust."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":10,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"As it should.  Doesn't the trustee have to disgorge whatever he makes by improper use of the trust funds?"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":5,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"May I ask you a question that is not a technical bankruptcy question, but he -- the objective of filing for bankruptcy was to get rid of this judgment debt, this Illinois judgment debt, right?"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":5,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"And the Eleventh Circuit said -- you know, we're really sympathetic to that, but the problem is that the bank would not let you sell the collateral.  If you could sell the collateral, then you could pay off the loan and you wouldn't need to declare bankruptcy. Did you bring such a suit, the suit that suggests that the bank was the culpable party here by not letting you sell the property which would have enabled you to pay the debt?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":6,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Counsel, give me your best answer to the rule that we should write, okay? Forgetting that I don't accept that you need a mental state, okay?  Let's go to just the loss issue. If I agree with you that you need to prove the loss, this is a very unusual trust because the measure of what the trust's res should be is fixed.  It was the amount of the trust plus the fixed interest, essentially.  This is a very unusual trust.  In the norm, the trust just says to the trustee invest prudently.  And the trustee self-deals by taking the res out, puts the investment in his or her own name and takes the profit. In that situation, how would you measure the loss?  In the normal self-dealing where the trustee just has to invest prudently and is depriving the trust of that investment value, would you say in that situation  that the loss is measured by the lost opportunity?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":6,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Because there is a difference between what the trust loses and the gain that the trustee makes, which under normal trust principles the gain has to be disgorged. Are you separating out those two things and how are you separating them out and how would I -- how would we write -- the Court write this opinion to give loss meaning?  What's the -- what's the meaning you want to give it?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":6,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"So under your theory, the profit to the trustee is never a measurement."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":6,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Assume that that is distasteful because for all the reasons the government argues in its amicus brief, the idea that a trustee could self-deal is the height of a breach of fiduciary duty. So give me something that -- that would win your case without upsetting the fact that defalcation somehow should, in the norm, include something as egregious as self-dealing.  You don't think your guy did because he didn't know, but let's assume the worst case, the guy knew."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":5,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Mr. Byrne, I -- I wasn't finished asking you about the background of this.  It -- it seems the simplest thing, if the bank is the culprit, then why not go after the bank and then get the money which would make the Chapter 7 unnecessary?"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":5,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"But it was what the Eleventh Circuit thought was a solution to this problem."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":5,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"And were they wrong in --"},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":7,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"The briefs -- the briefs  on your side of the case say, well -- you know, there is a series of words here:  Fraud, defalcation, embezzlement, larceny. But really, fraud and defalcation are defined in a further way where embezzlement and larceny are not.  Fraud and defalcation, while acting in a fiduciary capacity, then embezzlement and larceny. So I'm not quite sure it's fair to say that all four words must be consulted for the use of generous because fraud and defalcation are qualified by \"in a fiduciary capacity\" and then a comma."},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":7,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Yes.  In that respect, I think the word \"fraud\" gives you some assistance in arguing your case."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Bensinger?

Or do you need a further criminal intent?"},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":7,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Well, of course, that's one of the things we are arguing about here.  I don't think that's conceded."},{"name":"JUSTICE ALITO","id":4,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"You think recklessness is required?"},{"name":"JUSTICE ALITO","id":4,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"You think recklessness is  required?"},{"name":"JUSTICE ALITO","id":4,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Recklessness as to the law, as to what the law requires of the trustee."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":8,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Oh, yes.  Wait, wait.  You say -- you mean either, both?  I mean, there is no doubt here, I agree with you, as far as the act is concerned. It wasn't just reckless, it was intentional.  So you don't have to worry about that one. Thus Justice Kennedy's basic question I'd like to hear your answer to.  I thought it might have come from the other side, but you -- you concede, I take it, that there has to be an element in which the person not only knows what he has done, but that he does it with an element of moral turpitude; i.e. he knows that the law forbids it or -- or are you conceding this and then fill in the blanks, or?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":8,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"All right.  Then if that's  your position, what do you say to what Justice Kennedy said, add in Justice Harlan's comment that embezzlement and larceny are set off.  These two concern fraud and defalcation in respect to the trust.  There is a case of this Court that says fraud in respect to the trust requires an element of moral turpitude. That suggests a knowledge that what you are doing violates the law.  And if we read in pari materia, we get the same kind of requirement for this, indeed more so.  Indeed, you just conceded it existed even in respect to embezzlement, which is outside the parenthesis."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":8,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Why?  Defalcation on your definition would seem to be more likely to be thought innocent by someone who commits it in some circumstances than would fraud."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":8,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"No.  It may mean, for example here, fine, okay, no fraud, but what you did was you took some money that belonged to the trust given by  your father to help your mother.  And your mother says, help me, and the brothers and sisters will benefit well too.  And so you go to your insurance guy and he says, sure, no problem.  And then, lo and behold, they did it. I mean, innocence just radiates from what the conduct was as described. (Laughter.)"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":10,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"I don't understand.  Where does this reckless act come from?  Where do you get reckless act out of either fraud or defalcation?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":10,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Perhaps so.  Where did they get it from? (Laughter.)"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":6,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"What does it matter if  the money is missing?  What does it matter the reason why in terms of recklessness or intent?  You took the money.  Justice Breyer and I both agree you intended to take the money.  So why are you adopting the need for recklessness, unless you're trying to avoid the second component that the other side's talking about, which is that you caused a loss to the trust?  Because that's where you have a problem here, where you have a problem because there really is no loss to the trust in a traditional sense."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":6,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Well, the problem is that, yes, there was a breach of the trust.  But in terms of the terms of the trust, the trust got every penny that it would have earned if the money had not been taken.  It got the trust plus the fixed 6 percent that the trust was entitled to.  So it suffered no loss in its traditional sense."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":10,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Well, the -- why are you giving away that it's not in the traditional sense?  I think it's a loss in the traditional sense.  The trust was entitled to whatever profit was made from the use of its funds, right?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":10,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"And he made a quarter million dollars that should have belonged to the trust. It's not enough to say, well -- you know, I'll pay you 2 percent interest or whatever the going rate of interest was.  He made $250,000 which should have been given to the trust."},{"name":"JUSTICE ALITO","id":4,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"But the question here -- the question here is not whether the trustee is liable. Yes, the trustee is liable.  The question is whether it's dischargeable."},{"name":"JUSTICE ALITO","id":4,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"And if you look at the other, the other words in this list, fraud, embezzlement, larceny, those are -- those are bad acts. There is a degree of moral culpability involved and maybe there are people who commit fraud, embezzlement and larceny and don't realize that it's illegal, but there are not many.  It's commonly understood that those are bad. So in a very impressionistic sense, there is a difference between that and the kind of conduct that's presented to us here.  But you think that's irrelevant."},{"name":"JUSTICE ALITO","id":4,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Well, what about a reasonable trustee who just invests very imprudently, an unreasonable trustee who invests very imprudently?  Any reasonable trustee would realize that investing in -- you know, the widget factory totally unrelated to him is a really bad idea and money is lost there. What about that trustee?  Is that a defalcation."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":8,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Is it -- before we leave this conduct, I mean, I understand I was painting you a picture of they're being innocent.  But we are in a court that this Court has described as a court of equity or akin thereto."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":8,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"One principle I used to learn was he who has clean hands can come into equity, but not anybody else. Now, we have two lower courts that are saying your client has pretty dirty hands or at least they don't understand it.  That this, the other client has tried to get him to sell the property, but they write the properties are abandoned and uninsurable. Even though Mr. Bullock produced a buyer, they won't sell it. And so do you have clean hands?  Not you yourself.  You didn't take the money and you do not have dirty hands, all right? But did your client here, does he lack clean hands because two courts have said he should have just sold his collateral and he would have gotten the money and saved everybody a lot of trouble?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":8,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Because?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":8,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Did we remand it so they could?"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":5,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"So there's nothing in the record that shows why the bank refused to release any of the collateral?"},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":7,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Well, a number of embezzlers -- not all of them -- many embezzlers fully intend to pay everything back once things turn out all right.  But there's still an embezzlement.  But there is also a criminal intent at the time, or a wrongful intent, even if -- even if you plan to pay it back.  And it -- it seems to me that you're standing very firm on the fact that defalcation means something different than fraud in the first clause, or embezzlement and larceny in -- in the following clause."},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":7,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"And the problem is, as the -- your friend on the other side points out, that there's two problems with this.
