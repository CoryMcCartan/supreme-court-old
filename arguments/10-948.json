Suppose the disclosure provision didn't exist at all, but that instead of that liability provision, you had a provision that simply said:  Any person injured by a violation of this Act will have a right of action or will have a right to sue under this statute.  And then you had the waiver provision that you have in this statute.  Is that enough?"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":5,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Mr. McConnell, you started with the notion that the disclosure provision in the statute is meant to apply to ordinary people, and if an ordinary person not schooled in the law read \"you have a right to sue,\" wouldn't they understand that to mean I have a right to sue in court?"},{"name":"JUSTICE ALITO","id":6,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Can you imagine any statutory language that would eliminate the right, the ability of the parties to enter into an arbitration agreement other than language that expressly prohibits the waiver of the right to sue in court in favor of arbitration?"},{"name":"JUSTICE KAGAN","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Mr. McConnell, the cases that you cite in support of your position rest on a distinction between procedural rights and substantive rights, which you invoke here.  But where does that distinction itself come from?  Because it seems very atextual in nature, that distinction, which does appear in the cases.  But when Congress talks about rights, why should we think of rights as limited to substantive rights rather than also procedural rights?"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":5,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"But the -- the Act in Gilmer did not designate court action or right to sue as a right within the non-waivable provision."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Do you think a -- the word \"lawsuit\" typically describes an arbitration proceeding?  If you're subject to an arbitration, would you say, I'm in a lawsuit?"},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Well, why doesn't a right to sue refer to a lawsuit?"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":5,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"No, if this were written to be read by and understood by lawyers, I think you would have a stronger argument.  But this is meant for consumers, and they read \"you have a right to sue, and that right is not waivable.\"  A right to sue -- they're not going to think about cause of action.  They don't know what cause of action is.  But they do know that a right to sue is a right to bring a lawsuit."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":5,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Is that in -- is that in the statute?  Or is it just a colloquial --"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":5,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Yes, but Title VII doesn't say \"right to sue.\"  It's a name that the agency uses, but it's not -- it's not in the statute.  The statute doesn't say you have a right to sue."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"One way you could do it is that the right to sue is more familiar colloquially.  If somebody, you know, hits your car and you jump out angrily and say -- you can say:  I'm going to sue you.  You're not likely to say:  I'm going to bring a cause of action against you.  (Laughter.)"},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":7,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"In a standard arbitration agreement, if Smith and Jones agree to arbitrate and Jones then brings suit in court, and that action is then stayed pending arbitration, has there been a breach of the arbitration agreement simply by bringing the suit?"},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":7,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"I mean, doesn't that happen rather often?"},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":7,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"And, of course, suits are brought after arbitration to enforce the arbitration award."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":5,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Except that this is not what the parties decide.  These are take it or leave it contracts.  So, the consumer doesn't really elect arbitration.  It's just presented as part of the terms that the consumer can take or leave and not negotiated."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":5,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"It's a question of whether we take that into account in -- in determining what \"you have a right to sue\" means."},{"name":"JUSTICE KAGAN","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"You know, except if Congress indicates otherwise and --"},{"name":"JUSTICE KAGAN","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"And I guess that the problem here is that there is this language in this disclosure provision which is meant, you know, truly to inform consumers about -- about their rights and about where they're going to end up resolving their disputes, and it says \"you have a right to sue.\"  And you're asking us essentially to read that language as:  You have a right to bring a claim in court, but it's probably going to end up in arbitration because of the nature of your form contract. And that seems a very different kind of statement to consumers."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Nelson.

I just don't see any history here that supports your reading."},{"name":"JUSTICE KAGAN","id":4,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Well, Mr. Nelson, but your friend Mr. McConnell says quite rightly that the rules in this area have been fairly clear, that Congress knew it had to make especially clear that it wanted to void arbitration agreements.  So, if that's the case, why didn't Congress do what it has done in a thousand other statutes -- or maybe that's an overstatement -- but a number of other statutes, which is to say so?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":8,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Right.  And -- and you don't need a magic word, but it seems to me you need something more than a provision dealing with what you have to tell to the people who -- who accept these contracts.  I mean it's not in the substantive part of the statute.  It's in the part of the statute that tells you what provisions of the -- of the Act you have to notify the consumer of.  It's a very strange way for Congress to say \"no arbitration\" by putting this language in a section that has nothing to do with the rights under the Act."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":8,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"It is intended to be a summary of the rights under the Act."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":8,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Do you think that Gilmer would have come out differently with regard to one of the procedural rights involved in that case if the statute had happened to refer to that procedural right as a right?

That can't be right."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":8,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"I don't think that referring to a procedural right as a right creates any inference at all.

Your argument is the waiver -- the non-waiver of rights provision would normally be read to mean non-waiver of substantive rights, but the notice given to the consumer here, which refers to the procedural right to sue as a \"right,\" eliminates that presumption. So, I presume, therefore, that your position is that all procedural rights under this statute cannot be waived.  Because, I mean, that's what we're talking about:  What does \"right\" mean --"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":8,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"-- when it says rights are not waived?  And our prior case law says ordinarily that means only substantive rights.  But here in this statute, it refers to the right to sue, which is certainly a procedural right, as a right.
