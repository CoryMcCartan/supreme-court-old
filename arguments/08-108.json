It doesn't even make any difference whether he knew the owner was some private farmer or the United States. In this case, you have got two really big categories of different kinds, and instead they are treated alike is the thing that troubles me here."},{"name":"JUSTICE STEVENS","id":9,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"You can do it in this statute. That is the point."},{"name":"JUSTICE STEVENS","id":9,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Even that isn't -- I mean, here you are treating it as if it is a separate thing. That is fair enough. And what are the words \"of another person\" doing there if really they are not supposed to make any difference in terms of mental state?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":5,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"I could understand your argument if you are saying you cannot tell from the tell simply from the text what the answer is. You can only tell the answer if you say -- know what the answer is if you say Congress had victims in mind, and if we are going to worry about victims, we are not going to worry -- we are going to take a narrow rather than a broad view of \"knowingly.\" If that's your position, you agree that if you simply look at the text of this statute without considering confessional policy, you don't win?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":8,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Does it -- does it even come close to supporting it? I mean, let's start out with your analogous position. Your analogous position is that the \"knowingly\" simply refers to the -- the - - the three acts which are specified by which the identification can be -- can be -- the misidentification can be perpetrated. Transfers, possesses or uses. Could Congress possibly have said, gee, he might not know that he was acting to transfer or to possess or to use. That is not the serious possibility. So, \"knowingly\" has to refer to something more than the three possible acts. And once you get beyond the three possible acts, and you say, well, we are going to draw the line between \"without authority\" and \"another person,\" that seems like an arbitrary line. And the arbitrariness of the line seems even more obvious when the \"without a lawful authority\" is set off as a parenthetical. And the real logic of the statute -- the real -- the operative description is \"a means of identification of another person.\" That's why, it seems to me, if you look at the text, you could say, well, of course, the \"knowingly\" has got to refer to the everything that follows, both lawful authority and another person. And that's why, it seems to me, if you are going to win, you have got to win on the grounds that Congress wouldn't have meant what seems so natural, because Congress wanted to help victims not defendants. Where am I going wrong there, if I'm going wrong?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":8,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Is it worth two years?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":8,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"The only thing that we know for sure that is that Congress said it is not worth two years extra unless that of another person was involved. And if that is so significant or necessarily significant in getting a two-year add-on, then it seems reasonable, I suppose, that Congress -- the state of mind -- that."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":8,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"All Congress has got to do is to say \"recklessly.\""},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":8,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"It's an -- it's an accepted term. Every -- well, almost everybody knows what -- is a model Penal Code standard, and so on. All they have to do is put the word \"recklessly\" in there. It would cover every \"knowingly\" case. It wouldn't omit anything that is covered by this, and it would solve precisely that problem. And they didn't do it."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":8,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Well, I tell you what cuts one way or another. I -- I find it -- I find it, well, not surprising because I have heard -- I have heard the government do it before. You acknowledge that this is an ambiguous statute. That -- that on its face it -- it could mean the one thing or the other. I would normally conclude from that that we apply the Rule of Lenity. Since it could go either way, let's assume that the defendant gets the -- the tie goes to the defendant. What -- why shouldn't I resolve it that way?"},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Shouldn't it - - shouldn't it -- is it time to revisit the Court's decision in Hayes? (Laughter.)"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":5,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"All that is true, and that is actually where I was going. It -- it seems to me where the ambiguity is precisely -- is that none of us doubts, I don't think, that what Congress is after with this extra two-year mandatory is identity theft. And where the argument lies is between did Congress do this by punishing people only who intend to engage in identity theft or people who, while not intending to do so, have that effect. That's the issue."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":5,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"And I don't thing I can resolve that one way or the other from anything you have said. It is rather hard to say. So, therefore, suppose I use the Rule of Lenity this way, which I am trying out. I am not buying it. In the case of mandatory-minimum sentences, there is a particularly strong argument for a Rule of Lenity with bite. And that is because mandatory minimums, given the human condition, inevitably throw some people into the box who shouldn't be there. And if this person should be there and we put him outside, the judge could give him the same sentence anyway. So the harm by mistakenly throwing a person outside the box through the Rule of Lenity to the government is small. The harm to the individual by wrongly throwing him into the box is great. The Rule of Lenity is, therefore, limited to a very small subset of cases where it has particular force, but this is one of them."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":5,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"That's why I raised it."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":4,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"You have to rename it the rule of, you know, who gets hurt the most or something."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":6,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Then what about the - - the even division -- I think it is an even division, 3/3 -- is it a 3/3 split? And if you wanted one indication that this statute is indeed grievously ambiguous, it is that -- that good minds have reached opposite conclusions with well-reasoned decisions on both sides. So it seems to me that this is a very strong argument that this is an ambiguous statute, unusually so. And I factor into that the answer that was given to Judge Friedman's question, which astonished me the first time I read it: That the prosecutor would say, Your Honor, I am saying no different degree of culpability. One happened to get a fictitious number; the other happened to get a real number; two years for the second one. There is no difference at all in the state of mind of -- of the two defendants.

Why in the world would Congress want to draw such a line?"},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Yes, but in this particular case, when you talk about identity theft, it is inconceivable the defendant would not know about fact that there is another person involved.
