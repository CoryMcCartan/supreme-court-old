Not the application to this particular complaint, but as to the -- the standard. What do you see as the difference between the Federal standard and the West Virginia standard?MR. MONAHAN: The main difference, Justice Alito, is that our court has -- and they cite this in In re Rezulin, for instance. They cite Newberg on Class Actions as one of the authorities to support this principle, but they note that in -- in our court that normally challenges based upon reliance, causation, and damages will not bar certification on a predominance basis, because those go to the right of the individual to recover, but not to the overall liability issues of the defendant, which it believes can be addressed as common issues in many cases and save the court an extreme amount of time addressing those common issues. Now, the court indicates that if individual trials need to be conducted later on, on any of those issues, if there are truly individual issues that need to be resolved concerning those claims, individual trials can be accomplished."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":6,"spokeBefore":3,"sideBefore":"justices","text":"On the ground that the court here, the Federal court, decided that there weren't predominant issues based mostly on the fact that, like the Virginia court has now, it's decided that there is no economic loss, what were the differences?

That's a lot of conditions, but those are the three conditions of this case. So, what in due process requires that outcome, your outcome?MR.

Now, he could go to the judge and say: Judge, I want you to reconsider your procedural ruling in light of the fact I'm here. How does the situation I've just sketched differ from this one? I mean, you have a client who's coming to the litigation late. He's separate from the litigation, I know, but he could send a representative to the judge and say: Judge, I want you to reconsider in light of the fact I'm joining. Now, I know I'm not joining; in fact, I'm bringing a different case.But I'm thinking of the -- of the Chief Justice's hypo, here and I'm -- and I'm trying to apply it.

I don't believe that's the case because there are limitations to that. One would be, I think, if you filed at another Federal court, for instance, Rule 23 would be the same legal standard.

Would that be a -- then they would retain their individual claims, but there could not be another -- another class action -- another class action filed. Would that be a due process violation?MR. MONAHAN: In all other Federal cases, I believe that that might survive a due process challenge, because you're limiting it to the same legal standard in those cases. Certainly, I think you could -- because -- because it would be applying, though, to absent class members who were not truly parties, I believe some of those due process concerns could be raised.

We're saying -- we're not saying we didn't get any benefit from it; we're just saying we paid more money for it than we should because it wasn't of the quality that it was represented to be. When the Federal judge said, having to makea determination of West Virginia law, no, it's not the law; you have to show causation, some harm to you.

We're going to stop that court from proceeding altogether.And the anti-suit injunction is -- it's a very strong weapon, and even though it's the -- the clients who are being precluded, it's really saying to another court: We're not even going to let you get to this question; we're going to stop you. So maybe you could be right about preclusion but wrong about use of the anti-suit injunction."},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":9,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Well, of course, you're arguing the principle.

Would that preclude a later Federal court from granting class certification?"},{"name":"JUSTICE KAGAN","id":5,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Mr. Beck, the re-litigation exception of the Anti-Injunction Act speaks in terms of judgments. Why is the denial of class certification a judgment?"},{"name":"JUSTICE KAGAN","id":5,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"But the judgment, if I understood it correctly -- there was just a contemporaneous summary judgment motion, and the court granted summary judgment as well. But the denial of class certification isn't responsible for the judge's dismissal of the suit."},{"name":"JUSTICE KAGAN","id":5,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"So that sounds like a verycontingent answer to my question.
