I would think -- I don't see how you get away from the policeman unless you speed, and there are going to be pedestrians. Who knows? But I think that was pretty -- at least as bad -- at least as much of a risk as burglary. So that would be the end of the case. It would be simple. At least assume that. Now, then, however, suppose we have a State which says: But it's a worse thing to run away and create a risk. In a separate provision. It's a worse thing. All right? Then I'd say, huh, now I'm not so sure. Why didn't they charge the worse thing? Thismust be reserved for cases where it isn't. So here we have a rather weird situation. They're saying it's a different thing but not a worse thing. So now I say: Well, why didn't they charge -- Huh? Now I don't know. I don't know why they didn't charge the separate special one.

If we were to look at all of the cases that are prosecuted under what I'll call the simple offense, we might discover that those are all cases in which there is no serious potentialrisk of physical injury created because all of the risky cases are prosecuted under the aggravated label. We might also find that there are still a great many cases that involve a serious potential risk that are prosecuted under the simple category.
