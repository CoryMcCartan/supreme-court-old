So their point is, call it what you wish, but where you have a claim which amounts to a claim that my product does not infringe his patent, the rule that should apply is the person who owns the patent should have to prove that the claims do cover the product. And there are a lot of good reasons, et cetera, that they put in their brief why that should be so.   It's easiest for the patentee to know in what respect it violates the claim.   Normally, a patent, being a monopoly, should not have too many advantages beyond the scope of the monopoly. And we don't like false patents because Alderson Reporting Company that -- you'd have different results in the same kind of patent with different people depending upon whether, in some other instance, your client brought a suit or whether this was -- I mean, you've read the arguments.

You keep on saying it's a question of claim coverage, but the question of claim coverage, all that is, is part of an infringement analysis. And that's the analysis, as Justice Kennedy said, that's the analysis that would have been appropriate if Medtronic had stopped paying royalties and MVF had sued Medtronic as a result for patent infringement. And that's the world that we're supposed to imagine after MedImmune, is if, contra the -- the actual Alderson Reporting Company agreement, the licensee stopped paying royalties, and we think about an infringement suit."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":10,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Well, how -- what do you do with the government's argument here, which I take it as being on page 17, they make an argument which, as I understood it -- which is a big qualification -- the -- the -- some of these things are awfully complicated. You might have a -- a claim or, really, it's a set of claims that cover 48 pages with all kinds of symbols and -- and 42 different sort of division possibilities. And -- and then the -- the so-called infringer, or the person who falls outside the coverage, is looking at his product, and it's one of the most complex things you've ever seen.   And he has to think to himself, well, how -- how am I supposed -- how does the claim cover this?   And -- and it's -- there are many, many, many possibilities. I take it that's what they mean when they say it makes sense to put the burden of demonstrating how the claim limitations map onto the accused product because infringement may be found only when the product falls within the scope -- scope of the asserted claim or claims in every respect. Your client, who's the patentee, knows how. Otherwise, he wouldn't be bringing this infringement suit or the inside-the-coverage suit or responding to Alderson Reporting Company someone who says it's outside the coverage. But -- but the person who is the alleged infringer might not know it, and therefore, it makes sense to put everything in the same place; notice of infringement, burden of production, burden of proof.
