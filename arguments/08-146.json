"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Before you leave the text, it says as you -- \"referable to arbitration under an agreement,\" but then it says \"shall on application of one of the parties.\" How do we know whether that is parties to the litigation or parties to the arbitration agreement?"},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"And what -- what is the \"controversy\"? Is it the controversy asserted to be subject to arbitration or something else?"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"In practice, are there decisions in which -- and I'm assuming that you are right on the jurisdictional question -- in which a nonparty to the arbitration agreement but a party to the litigation has, in fact, succeeded in getting a stay under section 3? I mean, one question is -- and that's the question on the merits -- assuming that a -- that a party to the litigation, not a party to the arbitration agreement, can come to court and say, court, stay the action pending arbitration. Have there been cases in which section 3 stays have been issued on the request of someone who is not party to the arbitration agreement but is a litigant in the case?"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Well, the question - - ability is one thing. It means they -- they have the capacity to apply under section 3. I was just wondering how in practice -- I mean, here's a case where you have three parties together counseling a certain tax shelter. One of them enters an arbitration agreement with the enterprise that they are advising. The other two, sophisticated players, do not. My question is, conceding jurisdiction, it seems to me unlikely that a court would listen to two such people who were perfectly equipped to get an arbitration agreement themselves and didn't."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"I -- I don't see that the -- that the section 3 stay follows from that. It may very well be that in whatever ultimate forum the case is thrashed out in that the -- that the nonsignatories will be able to enforce the arbitration agreement. The question here is whether they can get a stay in midstream in order to litigate that as a separate issue. And one argument for saying that they should not, that the stay right should be limited to signatories, is that the policy of the -- the Federal Arbitration Act is to enforce arbitration agreements. It is not a policy simply to promote arbitration under all possible circumstances. It is a policy to enforce contracts because the contracts, in effect, were being given short shrift before the act was passed. If the policy is one to enforce contracts and, as Justice Ginsburg said, they had a chance to make an arbitration agreement and they didn't do it, then that is a good reason to say the Federal courts will not stay the proceedings in midstream for somebody who didn't get the agreement that that person could have gotten. What is your answer to that argument?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Including -- and -- and you're saying that that covers, in effect, even a point of Federal procedure as to whether you get, in practical terms, an interlocutory appeal.

The one party that has the arbitration agreement is out of the picture, so you have an arbitration agreement effectively with no one, that two parties who have no arbitration agreement are trying to enforce: The difference between parties to the litigation joining in an ongoing arbitration brought by either party to the arbitration agreement, and relying on an arbitration agreement effectively without two parties to it."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"But if you have a party to the agreement who is no longer in the picture, doesn't that change things?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"May -- may I ask you this? Let's assume State law said we -- we don't recognize stays at this stage of the game. Therefore, we will not give a stay to anyone. Would State law prevail?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"But isn't that the problem? That's what I'm getting at. Isn't that the problem for you in this case? Because you keep arguing that their substantive rights under the agreement are issues of State law, but the question before us is not one of ultimate substantive right. At some point there will be an -- an appellate process open to them and they can assert those substantive rights if they didn't get them at trial. The issue here is not substantive right. The issue here is a procedural right, and it's a procedural right which depends upon the terms of the Federal statute, and that's why it seems to me that it may very well be that the Federal statute determines not only the procedural right, the stay, but who may ask for it, that being a sensible Federal question rather than a State question."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"And your argument depends upon, as Justice Scalia pointed out a moment ago, reading section 2 as in effect incorporating State law for purposes of determining substantive rights."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Okay, but that still begs the question whether the -- whether the incorporation of State law to determine substantive rights controls the question of what law determines procedural rights, when a Federal procedural right is claimed, which is what is involved here."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"And regardless of State law the answer to the Federal question is independent of it."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Then I'm -- I'm missing the logic of your argument."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"But they are Federal procedural devices and State law could not contradict them.

You agree at that point that of course the Federal law would prevail?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"It would apply to what the judge is supposed to do at that moment when somebody says, I want a stay.

I don't understand your answer to that question, or your statement that your argument is dependent on the resolution of that choice of law issue. Are the courts of appeals unanimous on the question of whether the enforceability of an arbitration agreement by a nonparty is a question of State law? I think there's at least a Fourth Circuit decision that says it's a question of Federal law, but why -- why do we have to decide that and why is your argument dependent on it? Suppose that is, suppose that were a question of Federal law, what would that -- it might change the ultimate outcome of whether there's an entitlement to a stay, but I don't see why it has any effect on a question of whether there is jurisdiction."},{"name":"JUSTICE ALITO","id":6,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Nor does it mean that you necessarily cannot enforce the arbitration agreement, does it?"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"But if you read section 3, if you interpret, as you do, the word \"parties\" to mean parties to the litigation, then for purposes of jurisdiction the only thing is, is this person a party to the litigation? Yes. End of case; they can move for a stay. Then whether they're entitled to one because of this equitable estoppel theory which is determined by the State law is a merits question. You are making a more complex jurisdictional argument than I understand. What's wrong with the simple argument that section 3 says parties; that means parties to the litigation; the -- the Petitioners here are parties to the litigation. Therefore, they can move for a stay of the arbitration. And then we go to the merits and say, do they have a good reason for staying the arbitration? But you're presenting a more complex argument on the jurisdictional point which I don't quite understand."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"First, is there jurisdiction -- yes, appellate jurisdiction.

Maybe it was a shipper, or something, who they sent the contract to, and he had to figure out what to do on the basis of the contract. Or maybe there was a cousin who told me to go to see Smith in the first place. Maybe -- I don't know. There are a lot of people. So, now all those people have to go to arbitration? Because you're saying whenever I go in and have a contract with X and there's an arbitration clause, then in any future lawsuit where I sue anybody and that contract is an essential part of it, the breach thereof, he could put me in arbitration. Boy, that sounds extreme. I mean, I guess there are -- there'd have to be several treatises on this, but it doesn't sound intuitively sensible."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":7,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Oh, okay.

I understand it. I agree with it. As to the second point, you say -- I was surprised because I hadn't quite taken that in -- that we are now supposed to reach what we would call the merits of the appeal. Now, there you just heard your co-counsel say: Look, you don't have to decide whether my equitable theory is good or not. You haven't read the treatises, I have; which is a fair comment. And - - and all I want you to say is that sometimes, at least, a third party could enforce a contract to arbitration that two others make. The statute doesn't say he can't. The statute doesn't say he has to be the one who signed it. And if you think of a third party beneficiary or an assignment, for example, you would think, of course, there are other people, say an assignee, who could enforce it."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":3,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Then you might say that they haven't stated a claim on which relief can be granted, but that is the merits question.

And to decide that question I don't think you get into how meritorious their claim was for the stay."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":4,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Okay. And what is the criterion for identifying a section 3 stay?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":4,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"And your -- and your position is that the statute should be so construed that only a signatory to the written agreement has a right to the stay, indeed has a right to request the stay under article 3?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":4,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"What is your reason for saying that?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":4,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Yes."},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":8,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Well, what do you do with third party beneficiary assignment assumption?"},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":8,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Well, in a way that was where one of the parties, without the other party's consent, say assignee, a third party beneficiary. Here in a way it's a fortiori because the party who is objecting, his or its own actions caused the agreement to come into play. That's their theory."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":7,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Your proper -- I see this is actually a pretty difficult question to me, and - - because it seems to me sometimes they have to be able to enforce it, the assignee, the third party beneficiary."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":7,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"And now what I don't know, is what they're doing, it's true that section 3 and all the other sections, they talk about the agreement, but they don't say that the individual who is asking for the stay has to be the same person who signed it, as they couldn't. So how do we know which among all the possible people in the case who hasn't signed it should and should not be able to enforce it? Their argument is look to State law, okay? And your argument is derive some principles yourself. Really."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":7,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"And so, so -- is it possible to answer this case by saying he's wrong in thinking you always look to State law. It may depend on what the State law says. So that's the answer to the question. You should have had your appeal. Go appeal, and let the courts below work that out first, knowing that the State law is relevant but not always determinative. Then we'll get some -- we'll get some case law on this and we'll be in a better position to figure out what the right answer is."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":7,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Well, you see it's a little hard. I can imagine a case where they're sitting in the room drawing up the contract, they put it in the arbitration agreement. There are four other people directly related to the room. The parties look around and say, hey, we have arbitration here, I hope everybody understands everybody is going to have to do this. And they all say, okay, don't worry about it. Now, I would say, hey, maybe they're estopped. And there they're going right through the contract."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":7,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"So I hate to write the words \"equitable estoppel is never relevant.\" I would rather write the words \"I'm uncertain State law is relevant policy.\" You know, it's not true that it's always relevant."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":4,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Okay. Why shouldn't the Federal law be even simpler than that? And I -- I proposed one, and -- and probably because I don't understand the law well enough, it may -- may have been simply simplistic. But my suggestion was the -- the issue before us should be construed narrowly as being the question of who can ask for a stay. And the answer to that would be only a person -- or one possible answer to that would be only a person who has signed the arbitration agreement, because the Federal policy is to enforce agreements, not force arbitration. And, therefore, it is sensible as a matter of Federal policy to say, we're not going to stop this trial in mid-track for arbitration unless you who are asking for it to be stopped signed an arbitration agreement yourself, and it's that agreement that you're trying to enforce. Now, that is maybe a -- a too simplistic approach, but tell me what's good or bad about that."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":4,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Okay.

But it seems to me that that's not enough, because \"under the written agreement\" leaves open the question of whether the written agreement can be enforced right here and now by getting a stay only by somebody who signed it or by a third party beneficiary or -- or somebody dependent on the contract plus some other legal theory. My simplistic suggestion was: Keep it simple and simply say the -- \"under the agreement\" means an agreement signed by you, and the reason we confine it to an agreement signed by you is not because the phrase \"under this agreement\" tells us that. It doesn't. That leaves the question open. We say it is going to be confined to an agreement signed by you because that's really the -- the nub of the Federal policy. We want to enforce agreements, and we want to confine this extraordinary remedy of a stay to people who went to enough trouble to make -- and I don't know whether that's a good idea or not. And -- I mean it's favorable to you, so it's in your interest to say it's a good idea, but I may be getting into trouble by that. And that's what I want you to tell me."},{"name":"JUSTICE STEVENS","id":9,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Mr. De Marco, can I ask you this question?
