Is there anything to that?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":5,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"What do we make of what I understand was the court's post hoc statement that what was -- the reason for issuing the temporary injunction was the perception that there was a content basis at work? And what do we make of it in light of the fact - - I think this is of record; you correct me if I'm wrong. what do we make of that in light of the fact that I believe it is in the record that I forget the appropriate State official said, well, it's true we've let you do this in the past, but this is political or this looks political, which suggests that there was a content basis going on? What do we make of the court's statement and the record statement by the official in deciding whether there really was in effect a separate kind of order involved in the preliminary injunction from the order that was denied at the end of the case?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":5,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Oh, I know that. I know that."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":5,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Because that's why I asked, what do we make of the court's statement subsequently?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":5,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Is that so when there is some evidence in the record that a content basis actually was the criterion?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":5,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Now the 2001 order was it -- was it?

But when you got to the summary judgment stage, the particular peace demonstration performance was -- was behind them. So they're, I'm not sure that it would have been expected to be reinjected into the case."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":5,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"So it wasn't moot after the demonstration."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"That's one of the things that concerns me. I mean in many of these cases you have fairly elaborate proceedings over the preliminary injunction and the event takes place. I would not want to get to a situation where people feel the need to artificially keep a case alive simply to ensure their entitlement to attorney's fees. So how do you protect against that?"},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":6,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"But in, but in many cases the case will become moot after a period of time and the Chief Justice and I have the same concern. The question is directed to do we just keep this litigation alive for the -- for the ancillary issue of attorney's fees?"},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":6,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Well, we're asking about what rule you propose we adopt and the submission to you is that if we have a rule there can never be attorneys fees in this instance, that will then create pressure to continue the litigation when it's for all practical purposes of no real importance to the parties, other than to just establish attorney's fees. And that seems a waste of resources."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":7,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"But do we have to judge all preliminary and judgments alike? I mean, in some cases, the preliminary injunction is the thing. For example, suppose in this case, the demonstrators had said yeah, we went in with a -- with a broad challenge but we knew all we wanted was that peace demonstration, and we got it; so we're -- that's enough. We're not going to fight on."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":8,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Who -- who -- where does it say you have to have done that? My statute here says in any action to enforce a provision of 1983 -- the TRO or whatever was such an action. It says the court in its discretion may allow the prevailing party an attorneys' fee. Well, did they prevail fail or not? They got what they wanted. And it was such an action. Doesn't say anything about whether you have been declared horrible or wonderful or violator or not a violator. It says did they get what they want in the action? Answer, yes. End of matter. Now what's wrong with reading it that way?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":8,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Yeah, they got the legal claim. The legal claim is we want to have our demonstration on February 14; we have a right to do it and therefore issue an order. You said no, don't issue the order, because they don't. And therefore, they won."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":8,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"It is not?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":8,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Yeah. But what about the legal claim we are under the law entitled to a preliminary injunction."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"It is not a determination, is it, that they have a right to hold a demonstration?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"It is just a determination that we don't know at this point enough to say that you don't have a right."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":8,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Well I thought, where it say that in the statute that you have to have that particular kind of a claim?"},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"So what do you do in a situation of mootness where there's -- you know, they'd be happy to pursue the claim to establish that they prevail on a permanent junction as well as a preliminary one, but the case has become moot. Are they automatically disentitled to attorneys' fees in that case?"},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Well, there may be a pint to pursuing it but I'm not sure it's one that the locality governments -- I mean if you ask them the question, would you rather be liable for attorney's fees where you lose in a preliminary injunction but then the case becomes moot, or would you rather have to face individual officer liability to prevent the case from becoming moot? Or would you rather face ongoing litigation to prevent the case from becoming moot because there's too much invested in the fees -- they might choose the former."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Well, the plaintiffs decided to challenge it to the end. But I'm suggesting that if they know they might -- it might result in a loss of attorneys fees, when all they really wanted was a particular demonstration, others might pursue it differently."},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":6,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Well, you are saying the Chief Justice is proposing a rule. I think he was asking you -- you want to just give us all or nothing. And we're suggesting that it just doesn't make systemic good sense to insist that every preliminary injunction be carried through to a final adjudication for attorney's fees. And we are asking is there some midway ground. And you, you've so far -- you can structure the argument the way you want, but you so far are -- in effect telling me absolutely not."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":8,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"So what do you think, when this was enacted, to make up an example that it is as horrifying as I can think, where the Ku Klux Klan was riding in the South, and a group of civil rights demonstrators wanted to make certain they could have their demonstration outside the jail and they go to the judge and says the sheriff is involved in this, the whole town is; we want an injunction tomorrow. Tomorrow. Right now. So -- and we don't really care that much about the end of it, but we'll -- we'll go ahead and litigate it if you want. Now they get their injunction. They have the demonstration; it's over. I would have thought if there was a situation for which 1983 was written, it's that one."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":8,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Oh, there is. The other side has a lot of arguments. And they each have arguments. There are plenty of issues of law."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":7,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"But why should a plaintiff do that when the plaintiff's position is we got precisely what we wanted; this is not going to be - - this is a one-time only demonstration. We're not going to repeat this. Why force litigation, especially when we can say in this case, you lost on the merits? The judge made a prediction. Turned out that -- that that was wrong."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":7,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"So you get a case that involves a student. And -- and something like the DeFunis case. The student is admitted to the law school event. They have much controversy over this affirmative action program. The student graduates. And -- but the student has prevailed up until that time."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":7,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"But can't fight on because first, the student had gotten everything that he wanted and the case is moot. The student has graduated."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":7,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"On if you had a class action. He had a single action, and he's graduated."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":7,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Apart from the class action, what -- what else is there?"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":7,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Oh. Yeah."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Well, I mean, what if - - what if there's nothing else he can do? What -- what horrible does he face? He faces a horrible of having to pay for his own litigation, just like the rest of us do. I mean this is an extraordinary benefit we're talking about here, getting -- getting your attorney's fees paid.

How can that be, that a preliminary injunction resolves a dispositive question of law? Does that happen?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":4,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"But it wasn't the issuance of the preliminary injunction that resolved it, it was the appeal to this Court where we -- we resolved a question of law."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":8,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"What is the law in respect to this, which is right on the point you're arguing, that two parties have this kind of suit and the government party -- they settle it, and giving everything that the plaintiff conceivably wants, but at the end they say: We don't admit we violated the law. Can you get attorney's fees there or not."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":8,"spokeBefore":9,"sideBefore":"","text":"It's a consent decree, but no admission of a violation of law."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":3,"spokeBefore":9,"sideBefore":"","text":"I have never understood why that's an issue. Can't the parties -- it seems to me an exception that isn't consistent with the theory. Why can't the parties just agree on attorney's fees in the settlement agreement and the consent decree and then it wouldn't have to be an issue?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":5,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Okay, but the argument is undercut, as you yourself say, by the settlement rule. Don't we have the settlement rule simply because we want to promote settlements? We don't want litigation to go on and on and on simply because somebody wants to establish a right to attorney's fees. And doesn't that same reasoning apply here when there is a preliminary injunction and that's all the person wants. By the same reasoning that we accept a settlement, why shouldn't we accept a preliminary injunction as being a sufficient determination of rights to justify fees because we don't want it to go on and on and on when nobody has any issue of substance involved, but is just litigating for the sake of establishing a right to fees later?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":5,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"But the only attorney's fees that would be assessed would be attorney's fees attributable to the preliminary injunction."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":5,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"They have been found subject to a preliminary injunction.

So you could at least say that the innocent person who gets stuck with attorney's fees for settling gets what he asked for, right? It's voluntary."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":4,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"That may be, but that's not the way the statute is written."},{"name":"JUSTICE STEVENS","id":10,"spokeBefore":4,"sideBefore":"justices","text":"Would this case be different if the defendant had consented to the entry of a preliminary injunction?"},{"name":"JUSTICE STEVENS","id":10,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"So if this had been, if they had entered into a consent decree covering just the one event on the front burner, that would have been?"},{"name":"JUSTICE STEVENS","id":10,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"But if they consented to the entry of a preliminary injunction, why wouldn't that be equally binding?"},{"name":"JUSTICE STEVENS","id":10,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Well, they were able to go ahead with their one demonstration that precipitated the litigation, and they would have been able to do it the same way if they had a consent decree instead of having the other side not fight very vigorously in opposition to the preliminary."},{"name":"JUSTICE STEVENS","id":10,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"But then why isn't the attorney -- if there were a consent decree -- I don't understand the difference."},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":6,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"We have when election season comes many, many requests for injunctions, and after the election is over the case just goes away.

Let's say the preliminary injunction here was based on the ground that the decision was content-based, a factual decision, and at the permanent injunction stage the court finds that it was not content-based."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":7,"spokeBefore":2,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Even though you got what you wanted? You got to put on the show. I thought that at the end of the line, the judge said your First Amendment rights have not been violated, the nudity ordnance can be enforced. If you had come back again, say the next week, and said, we want to do another peace symbol, after the court has ruled on the permanent junction and you lost, you certainly couldn't prevail when you're coming back with another as-applied, when the court has said this ordnance is good and doesn't violate the First Amendment. That's correct. But if there were an intervening fact, if they permitted a performance of \"Hair\" and then said, but we'll enforce the nudity prohibition against your protest, then we would be able to come back. The final judgment in this case does not preclude future as-applied challenges, either content-based or arbitrary, and the district court recognized that when it made very clear that it did not reverse or repudiate its preliminary injunction ruling simply because we lost the permanent junction."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":7,"spokeBefore":7,"sideBefore":"justices","text":"I thought this court said, and correct me if I'm wrong, that you wanted to put on a demonstration that would be like the plays, that would be hidden from public view because you have a curtain or whatever around it.

As opposed to, as is often the case, they might say, you know, we consent to the entry of the preliminary injunction or we don't -- you know, we're going to save our energy.

And the reason I ask that is because when I look through the record it seems to me your clients are very interesting. They have their point of view. And their point of view, one of their points of view was that the state said you can have this demonstration, just wear a skimpy swimming suit. No. Well, you can have the demonstration maybe, I'm not sure of this, but we're going to put up a cloth so other people who don't want to see you don't have to see you. And there your client said, we won't pay any attention to the cloth. At least we didn't in the past. And then looking at that I thought, well, maybe what they got was, they got a preliminary injunction or a TRO, whatever you want to call it, but it didn't stop the State from putting up the cloth. It was pretty clear the State would, and it should have been pretty clear that they were going to ignore it, which they did.
