Can I ask about your interpretation of the phrase \"any air pollutant\"?  Because there are a lot of different interpretations that have gone on among the various briefs and among the lower court opinions in this case. So here are some choices, all right?  And I want really to ask you to pick what you're arguing for. Your original position was that \"any air pollutant\" meant any NAAQS pollutant for which the area is in attainment; that was your original position. Judge Kavanaugh's position is that it means any NAAQS pollutant.  There is another position that goes on in the briefs that says, no, it doesn't mean any NAAQS pollutant; it means any local pollutant, whether or not it's a NAAQS pollutant; and there is still another position that says it's really any regulated pollutant other than greenhouse gases. So those are four different interpretations Alderson Reporting Company that all of the folks on your side, and I realize there are a lot of them, have presented.

And then it turns out, since there's so many of the regulated things, that it just doesn't make sense to apply A, B and C and D to all of them.  So often I would think courts read in an exception where it makes no sense. For example, if there were a statute that said you have to throw out all bubble gum that's been around for more than a month.  Well, what about bubble gum used in a display case that nobody ever intends to eat?  You see?  And so what we do all the time is we say, well, it doesn't mean to apply to that.  Now, why can't we take the same approach or EPA takes the same approach here?  It says 250 tons or more and we apply that all over the place, except it doesn't make sense here, so we read an exception into it, unwritten, for places where it makes no sense?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":5,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"But I'm -- but I'm a Alderson Reporting Company little confused, because there have to be pollutants who -- where it doesn't emit just 250, where it emits a million.

But the conundrum that this cases raises is that everybody is violating a statutory term.  EPA is saying, no, we can't do the 100 to 250 with respect to greenhouse gases, but you are also violating a statutory term.  You know, it says any pollutant or it says in the other provision each pollutant subject to regulation.  Nobody would think that the most natural, most reasonable readings of those phrases are any pollutant if they have localized effects, but not otherwise. So I mean, what's happened here is that you have this new kind of emission that basically makes these two terms of the statute irreconcilable, and the Alderson Reporting Company agency has essentially picked one.  It said:  Look, we're not going to just exempt a broad class of pollutants.  Instead, we're going to fudge the numbers.

So you're essentially using those numbers to make distinctions as to the type of pollutant rather than, it seems to me a more sensible approach would be to say, look, the 100 and 250 numbers don't work for this new kind of pollutant, we're going to up the numbers, and that will leave the rest of the statute and all the purposes of Congress intact."},{"name":"JUSTICE KAGAN","id":4,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"But, General, if you think about the question of what any pollutant means, and you put aside this whole absurdity question that the numbers get you to, you just say, what does any air pollutant mean?

You would obviously choose EPA's version of the thing.  And the only reason that you're not choosing that is because of these numbers that are in the statute, which were designed only, only to distinguish between major and minor emitters. So if you can distinguish between major and minor emitters while keeping the completely sensible longstanding interpretation of any pollutant, why wouldn't you do that?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":5,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Let me ask you a question.

So you say we've got to do something about this statute because they don't really mean to every football game they're going to have a permit, or it doesn't mean every 500 people, like all of my relatives are together, they have to have a permit.  No, it can't mean that. So we have two choices.        Choice A, which is what you would like, is it means any air pollutant, any regulated air pollutant, but not greenhouse gases. Okay.

The new numbers are X and Y for that -- for this kind of pollutant. But, you know, and I understand that EPA may have felt like, oh, gosh, can we really do that?  But the solution that EPA came up with actually seems to give it complete discretion to do whatever it wants, whenever it wants to, and to not -- and to be much more problematic than if EPA had just said, no, it's not 100 and 250.

The issue is whether you can read in exceptions unnecessarily when the absurdity in question doesn't flow inevitably from the statute, when the statute can be interpreted another way that would not produce the absurdity. Aren't you compelled where there is ambiguity to adopt the interpretation of the statute that does not produce absurdity rather than adopting the interpretation that produces absurdity, and then going around altering the provisions of the contract -- of the statute?  I mean, to take Justice Breyer's bubble gum example, yes, I suppose it -- would you have to make an exception for bubble gum in the display window if the statute were subject to two interpretations, one of which would include display windows, and the other one of which wouldn't. It seems to me, of course, you would have to adopt the interpretation that didn't include display windows.  And that's what is going on here.  There's -- there's -- yes, there's absurdity but the issue is how is that absurdity to be taken account of?  By simply letting EPA rewrite the very clear numbers in the Alderson Reporting Company statute, or else by adopting a permissible interpretation of the statute that does not lead to that absurdity.

And that might be really unthinkable -- no, not unthinkable, but have worse consequences than worrying about the interpretation of this trigger provision. So either we have to do the one or the other.  Either we have to interpret the trigger provision with flexibility so that there are written exceptions -- unwritten exceptions in it, one way or the Alderson Reporting Company other, or we have to say you can't do that, and therefore they don't apply to all.
