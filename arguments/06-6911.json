United States. Mr. Coad. "},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"So if you had a statute -- a State like, I'm told, Vermont, that doesn't take away any one's civil rights, not even a first degree murderer's, then that first degree murderer would be equated to someone whose civil rights were taken away and then restored."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"They're not anomalies because the gun prohibition would cover them, even though they never had their civil rights taken away? Is that -- is that what you're saying?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Mr. Coad, how are -- how are civil rights which have been taken away typically restored? What is -- what is the process for restoring them? Just if you don't commit another offense within a certain number of years?"},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":5,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Well, but even -- even there I assume the law waits for a certain passage of time, and I would assume that there can be no felony committed during that interim period or the person's sentence has to be served or something? It's ongoing, it's prospective. And so restoration has a real component, in that -- that is not present in the statute that we're faced with here."},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":5,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Well, it is of -- maybe no difference if the operation of law is 24 hours later."},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":5,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"But I assume that's not the case. I assume that there's in every case, as Justice Scalia's question indicates, a certain passage of time that takes place."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Well, you -- you can say, however, that -- that in the restoring situation, there is at least a greater individuation of the -- of the State's determination of the -- the trustworthiness of the individual to be -- to be trusted with arms. That is to say well, this person has not committed an offense within so many years. Or maybe in some States, it may be an individual determination. That's why I asked you the question. Is it ever one by one, you apply to have them restored?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Well, I mean, that's - - that's a totally different thing from just a gross determination by a State that everybody who commits this crime does not lose -- does not lose firearm rights. I think it's -- it's -- there's a greater degree of assurance when you're dealing with those States that -- that have some degree of individuation. At least this is an individual who hasn't committed an offense for so many years. Or in those States where you have to apply personally, I think they're different situations."},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":5,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Well, but I'm suggesting -- and I haven't done the research -- that that's atypical."},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":5,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"I think it's atypical to give a felon one day in jail."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"But a misdemeanor? I see."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"I understand that - - I understand that it is rare for misdemeanants to lose their civil rights."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"But certainly the minority approach. In most States if you are convicted of a misdemeanor you do not lose civil rights?"},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"So your argument, if accepted, would essentially weed out, or at least for a majority of the States, weed out subdivision (a)(20)(A)(b) -- (a)(20)(B)? In other words, there's coverage under the statute if you are convicted under a misdemeanor and you want to say, well, if your civil rights were never taken away, you shouldn't be covered. Well, that would mean most misdemeanors aren't going to be covered."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Well, if I say most misdemeanors aren't going to be covered, it's not an answer to say, well, here's one State where they are covered. It's maybe 49 are not."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":6,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Mr. Coad, may I ask you a question that involves the comparison of what, for shorthand purposes I'll call Subsection (20) and Subsection (33). I take it, it is your position that - - and (20) applies here. But I take it that it's your position that under (33), your argument could not prevail because the language of (33) makes it clear that there's got to be a -- in effect, a revocation of the right first, before there can be a restoration within the meaning of that statute? You accept that?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":6,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Now that applies as I recall to cases, or primarily to cases, in which there has been a misdemeanor conviction for domestic violence, is that correct?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":6,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Okay. If your position prevails, then Subsection (20), which applies to more serious offenses, would in effect be held to provide for a restoration when, in fact, nothing had been taken away. Whereas under (33), which applies simply to a relatively minor set of crimes in relation to (20), would not provide this relief. So you would have the anomaly that in the more serious cases, you would win. In the less serious cases, you would lose, because the statute was more onerous. That's anomalous. And my point is, and this is what I want you to comment on, I'll assume for the sake of argument that you're pointing out an anomaly here if you just look at (20) alone. But if you look at (20) and (33), by going your way, we're going to create another anomaly, the other anomaly being that the more serious offense or the more serious offender gets better treatment than the less serious offender. So either way we go, there's going to be some anomaly. Am I right in reading it that way?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":6,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"But none of them is less serious in the classification of the crime than those covered by 33, because 33 simply covers a misdemeanor of domestic violence."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":6,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Yes, but the State's judgment about trustworthiness may very well be the same in each case. So the trustworthiness criterion, it seems to me, is being -- would be applied differently in the two cases if we take your position."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Isn't there another difficulty for you in this statutory comparison that Justice Souter has noted? You're argument under (a)(20) is that it would be absurd for Congress to take people, exempt people, whose rights have been restored, but not people whose rights were never taken away. That is exactly what Congress did in (a)(33). So if Congress thought it was all right even in albeit in a different context, it seems to me to be very difficult to argue that it is inherently absurd to do it somewhere else."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Are you sure about that? (33) applies to a number of different crimes, it seems to me, within every State. Are you sure that in none of those crimes the civil rights are not taken away for some of them, but are taken away for others?"},{"name":"JUSTICE ALITO","id":7,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Well, with respect to the in-State anomaly that you were talking about, the government argues on page 30 -- 29 and 30 of its brief that there really are only a few States where this exists, and even in those -- even in the States where it exists, there are very significant restrictions on the ability of the felon to obtain restoration of civil rights. Is that incorrect?"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Well, then, maybe the problem was that Congress included misdemeanants who were subject to over a two- year sentence. The point has been made that, on your reading, that was a futile gesture, or Congress did one thing that was cancelled out by someone else, by another provision. And then they put in this group of misdemeanants who were subject to an over-two-year sentence; but most of that group -- and in many states all of them -- would not have their civil rights taken away. So what is left of the group that was put in, misdemeanants with over-two-year sentences?"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"What was the point of putting that group in the statute as covered by the Career Criminal Act?"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"But how many would be - - take a State that doesn't take civil rights away and gun rights from misdemeanants. What effect in that State would this legislation have -- what effect would the provision of this legislation -- that says misdemeanants who are subject to a two-year -- over-two-year term are covered? It wouldn't be covered because the -- because they're not having their civil rights taken away."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"But does it make much sense, as -- as Justice Ginsburg suggests, to read (a)(20)(B) as covering almost nothing? I mean, you know, why go to the trouble of putting in that provision if it's only going to make a difference in those -- in those very few States where - - well - -"},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"You phrased Congress's intent as allowing an exemption for people the State has found trustworthy. But I don't think that's how this legislative process works. You have additional punishment, and then somebody says: Oh, let's not apply it to people who are convicted of antitrust violations. And you say: Yeah, yeah. And then somebody says: Let's not apply it to people whose civil rights have been restored. And they say: Fine. And then nobody pipes up and says: Well, let's not apply it to people whose civil rights were never taken away. In other words, it's not an intent that is not effectuated. It is just you want the intent to reach more broadly."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"So it's based on a congressional mistake, in other words, about the breadth, but it still doesn't - -"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Can we rewrite statutes like that? Because, gee, look at this statute. Congress didn't think about this, and it makes a really bad result here. So we're going to add this -- this new -- I don't think that that's how we operate."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"It's not that absurd if Congress did the same thing in (a)(33)."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"What about securities law violations? (A)(20)(A)says this doesn't apply if it's an antitrust violation. Now, did Congress -- you could say: Well, they would have applied it to securities law violations, too. It's a business offense. They're not interested in that. So we should read this as applying to securities law violations."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"That kind of begs the question for you to say Congress is worried about offenders States think are trustworthy. What they actually said are, of course, offenders who have had their civil rights restored. Maybe if they focused on the question of whether or not civil rights were taken away in the first place, they would have made a different judgment, as they did, of course, in (a)(33)."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Well, isn't -- under our precedents, isn't what you just said fatal to your case: In other words, Congress didn't think about this, or they made a mistake in thinking about it? In either case it's clear that they didn't legislate with respect to it."},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":5,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Do you know, since you seem to have looked at it: In North Carolina, for the person whose had his civil rights taken away, is -- is there any mechanism to get them back earlier by -- by applying for clemency or a pardon or - -"},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":5,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"That would be about the only way?"},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Thank you, Mr. Coad. Mr. Joseffer. "},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":3,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Everyone in this case. The point might be arguable in a case that involved that domestic violence statute. Everyone in this case. This case doesn't involve that other provision."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":3,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"There are cases in the pipeline that don't think it's as clear as day."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":3,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Yes."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":4,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"What court - -"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":4,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"What court of appeals was that? I didn't get that."},{"name":"JUSTICE ALITO","id":7,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"If Congress thought about the problem, what reason could they have for saying that the firearms ban should apply to someone who never lost his or her civil rights, but not -- but would not apply to someone who had civil rights restored? Automatically, let's say. Automatically and within a short period of time. What rationale reason could there be for doing that?"},{"name":"JUSTICE ALITO","id":7,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"I can understand that argument where there's an individualized determination about each -- each defendant, but I don't quite understand it when it's a blanket restoration of rights."},{"name":"JUSTICE ALITO","id":7,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"It's a formal difference matter.
