So, it's hard to figure out, because the direction -- you can't tell by the sound.  I don't know if there's a modern system that would help with that, but -- you're right. Suppose that the State -- suppose you're right. What I'd worry about -- and I'd like your response to this -- is that in bankruptcies, or weak firms -- a lot of firms are weak, and they owe a lot of money to the States.  So, the States figure this out after a while.  It takes a few years to seep through, but once they see what they can do, they say, \"Here's what we'll do.  Settle your claims against the State, which happen to be pretty good, for 50 cents on the dollar.  Give us the money.  And you're -- we're out of it.\"  So, they settle it. A month later, bankrupt. Now, two things have happened.  The States got 50 cents on the dollar, every other creditor gets 5 cents on the dollar, because they were a month ahead of it.  The second thing that happened is, the creditor -- the firm lost the chance to come in and be rehabilitated.  So, the result of this is two bad  things: bankruptcy's law's basic purpose, to treat creditors fairly, bankruptcy law's basic purpose, to give firms a chance to rehabilitate, are both seriously undermined.
