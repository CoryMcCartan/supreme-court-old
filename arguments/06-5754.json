Here we have a district judge, he hears all the arguments. The attorneys brought it out. It's in the file. He reads the presentence report.

So why -- why couldn't you say, you know, all these factors are taken into account by the commission? They start with an effort to a apply them in typical cases.

What I'm trying to do is to how much weight can a judge reading this give them without violating the Sixth Amendment? All I'm trying to do here is not whether the guidelines are good, bad, or indifferent. Congress wanted to apply them. We excised the mandatory to comply with the Sixth Amendment. Now, what else do we have to do to comply with the Sixth Amendment?

I mean, how do we know he's -- when he says I looked at the guidelines and I think they're appropriate, that he's considering himself bound by something that he may or may not agree with, as opposed to what he said? Which is, well, I cannot find that they're inappropriate?"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"How about the point that Justice Breyer made that these other factors have been taken into account by the sentencing commission because Congress told them to consider those same factors?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"There are two separate things there. The general aims of sentencing, the four basic aims of sentencing, I believe the commission certainly took into account. A separate thing was the rule that said you can depart only for a matter that has not been fully considered by the guidelines. And there the original version, I believe, said that we've considered nothing thoroughly. Except for certain specific matters that had been mentioned like age, race, and we'll refer to statutorily. Now, that is what you're thinking of? I mean, if that's what you're thinking of, I don't think it's relevant to what your present point is."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"That's because when they looked at all of the literature, they explained it, the rehabilitative purpose was not that it wasn't taken into account, it was there was a consensus among experts that there isn't much you can do about it. That's different from not taking into account."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":6,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Mr. Cochran, I have this concern: If we accept your submission that the district court should just consider the guidelines together with everything else, give them a presumption of validity, anything else, just something to consider, that would presumably eliminate any Sixth Amendment problem with the district court's findings of fact. But the district court's sentence is going to go on appeal. And the appellate court in reviewing it for reasonableness, let's assume in this case the appellate -- the appellate court says oh, no, this person had -- we find as a matter of fact, given the record, military service, you know, which we think should have been taken into account. And, therefore, we set it aside. Now, the next case that comes up, which doesn't have the element of military service, in all other respects the same as your client's case, it comes up to the court of appeals, and the court of appeals would say, ah, we don't have that different fact here and therefore we affirm the sentence. Isn't -- in other words isn't the finding of a fact necessary for the process of judicial review, even if it is not made necessary for the purposes of the district court's determination? He would not get that sentence but for this fact."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":6,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"So you haven't shown us a way out of the problem."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":6,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"No, even if you don't - - don't establish thresholds by reason of the guideline, you are establishing thresholds upon judicial review, guidelines or not. If the -- if the appellate court says, oh, given there's this fact in this case, the sentence below was reasonable, but in the next case, where that fact does not exist, the court of appeals says, ah, the sentence is unreasonable, in other words, that fact is made a necessary condition for giving the higher sentence.

And he says this seems to me no different than those and that's the sentence I'm going to impose. Is there any problem with that?"},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Yes, well, he looks at all the individual factors and he says they seem not terribly different from these 100 other cases and the range in those 100 other cases was, you know, 5 to 7 years, and so I'm going to give him 5 years."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"How is that different than the -- how is that different than looking at the guidelines, which did that in a much more comprehensive way, and saying, I don't see anything different in this case from the normal guidelines case and so I'm going to impose that sentence?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":6,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Well, it did incorporate them in that district judges were free to depart from the guidelines if indeed they found there was some one of these human factors not considered by the guidelines which existed in the particular case."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":6,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Well, if they were systematically removed then all of these other human factors that you're complaining about were considered by the guideline commission and were simply rejected."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Thank you, counsel.

A part of the guidelines in the heartland. If it's not the heartland, depart. Now, what I wonder is are we not back under your theory of it just to where we were when it started out, before the commission started ruling all these things out and began to make all its -- the judge could do that."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":4,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"We said we took nothing into account and therefore any circumstance that makes the case unusual would be in principle a ground for an exception."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":4,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"You're saying more than that is necessary."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":4,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"He could do this: He could set aside the guideline on the theory that the guideline itself is unreasonable, that is it doesn't properly take account of sentencing.

The mandate is gone. You say yes, they consider other things.

We're playing with standards and words here."},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":5,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"And when we talk about presumptions at the appellate level, that's actually a little strange in any event.

Uphold both of them?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":7,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"What is reasonable is -- is not merely a sort of number within a spectrum. It seems to me that what is reasonable is a function in part of the reasons that are given. And in the Chief Justice's view, two diametrically opposed reasons are given for two different sentences.

Fine. But the interesting problem is the problem of the next case which you're now talking about, is, well, what happens if the district judge and when should be the district judge and how free should the district judge feel he is to depart from the guidelines sentence even if it's not an unusual case."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":6,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Or some fact, not necessarily a particular fact."},{"name":"JUSTICE STEVENS","id":9,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"May I ask you, this is the hypothetical: Supposing a judge thinks military service is relevant, and he decides to impose a sentence a little below the guidelines.

And I think with respect to the court of appeals, I think I would be wise to impose the guidelines sentence, so I will do so even though my own judgment is that it should be slightly lower.

All that happens is the court of appeals says, look, in the case of bank robberies we've discovered about 33 percent of the defendants in the typical case have been in the Army. And therefore, we think that just ordinary armed services is not a reason, ordinary armed - - services in the military is not a reason for a diminished sentence. That's all, period. Or they can say it the other way, the absence of a military service is a reason for having the higher sentence, put it any way you want.

And then all of a sudden he says, I see you have military service, but I'm not going to give you a reduction. I mean, is he bound by some abuse of discretion standard to be a little bit consistent?

I think you were very helpful in saying this presumption for the guidelines is how the court of appeals evaluates a district court sentence, that there is no presumption that binds the district judge. But one of the main points that Mr. Cochran made in his presentation was the district judge has to give reasons. He -- this was just a summary paragraph at the end of the sentence hearing. He has to respond to what defendant presented. He has to respond to what the Government presented.
