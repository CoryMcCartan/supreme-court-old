And I can see the Secret Service saying, well, that's kind of a bad thing to make it public because there are people out there who want to kill the President, and if you go through your discovery and say, this is how we look at that situation, this is what we do, that gives people a -- a guideline for how to break through the security arrangements."},{"name":"JUSTICE ALITO","id":8,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"What -- then what does happen if a district court does allow discovery of things what the Secret Service thinks are confidential?

If there is improper motive for an arrest, but that there was an objective basis that would have made the arrest and that did make the arrest reasonable, there is no violation of the Constitution. Assume that's the law and forget clearly established, forget -- assume that's the law.  It seems to me that for you to prevail, you have to say we should make a First Amendment exception because the First Amendment is so important.
