I mean, that goes far beyond the other kinds of resale possibilities that you're talking about.  And I guess what I want to know is why you think a Congress that was geared towards this object of keeping guns out of the hands of dangerous people and set up a mechanism that had the gun seller be the kind of enforcer, at the point of sale, would have thought, oh, it's fine if a front, if a straw walks in the door."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"In -- in the situation that Justice Alito hypothesized of the person who's doing this several times a month and has the ad in the Yellow Pages, is that -- is that person subject to regulation as a dealer?"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":9,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"But this -- this family member, the uncle, residing in Pennsylvania, he could not have purchased that gun in Virginia, isn't that right, because he's a nonresident?"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":9,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"But wouldn't he -- wouldn't he have to comply with the 552(c), which says how somebody who doesn't show up in person can purchase a gun?

Now, we look to see what section is it material to, and you say in your brief it's material to the section that says -- you have two of them, but they come to the same thing -- selling or delivering any firearm to any person. All right. Now, he says did they sell or deliver this firearm to what you call the real purchaser.   No.  They sold or delivered it to the straw, and that's the end of the matter.   And at least the statute is open to this interpretation, and it's a criminal statute.   And besides, the ATF for a long time interpreted it that way.   So what we should do is Alderson Reporting Company interpret it strictly. Now, that's I think the basis of their argument if I understand it.   And so you have to get those words \"sale\" and \"deliver\" and explain how in a criminal statute they apply to what you're calling the real purchaser."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":7,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"But you also quote \"material,\" the need for it to be material to the lawful ness of the sale."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":7,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"You seem to concede that in the brief.

The narrow interpretation would also apply to a straw man who buys a gun for Al Capone. Alderson Reporting Company And so this -- this part of the statute would be virtually worthless.   Their response to that is don't worry about that. There are plenty of other provisions that will take care of that.   Are there?
