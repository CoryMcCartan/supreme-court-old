And -- and in a perfect -- sort of in a perfect system, I think your objection would be unanswerable. The trouble with the system we've got is -- is the trouble that -- that is -- is undisputed here, and that is, that most of these petitions, the overwhelming number of them, are going to be pro se petitions. Exhaustion can -- can be tricky.  The -- the statute of limitations is -- is going to run and -- and an individual can end up in the -- in the situation that this one had. What -- what he's asking for, in effect, is how do we tinker with the system, in effect, to prevent its being a -- a very unfair burden on people who don't have  the sophistication to help themselves."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":6,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Well, I -- I know but there's -- what -- what is your answer on the merits to the fact that most of the people who are going to ask for stay and abey are -- are going to be pro ses, or at least have gotten into the mess that they're in as a result of pro se representation, and -- and that -- that exhaustion in close cases can be a very -- very tricky issue?  What -- what's your response to that?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":3,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"I'm not sure -- I'm not sure it's -- it's true, are you, that -- that the reason people get into these situations is because they were pro se. That wasn't the case here.  I -- I think they probably get  into this situation very often because they have a better or at least a different lawyer at the Federal habeas stage than they had at the State habeas stage, and this new lawyer sees additional claims that -- that he wants to make.  Isn't -- isn't that exactly what happened here?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":8,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"It's typical.  I mean, what I have in the statistics is that about 36 percent of all the habeases are dismissed for failure to exhaust, and 93 percent of all of the habeas petitioners are pro se.  Now, the conclusions I draw for that is it's probably these pro se people -- I mean, 93 percent are pro se -- that will get the procedural dismissals, and certainly a third or so, if we agree with you, of all of the habeas petitions filed in -- in Federal court are going to be finished, terminated.  The door is closed because it takes a Federal court about nine months on average to process a habeas. Now, you just take that and you say, we've closed the door of the Federal court to a third of all the habeas petitioners.  And if I had thought that Congress wanted that, then I might say fine. But I thought that Duncan -- and I know I was on the other side of the case, but I felt the majority had a  pretty good point on the language, to tell you the truth. But what I didn't think they had such a -- I mean, I couldn't find much of a congressional purpose one way or the other there.  I thought the purpose of the statute of limitations is really to get people to file their petitions.  Once they file them, they have a year but it's tolled.  You know, I mean, you understand the thing. I -- I'm really looking for you to tell me some tremendously strong congressional purpose that's served so strong that you want to knock a third of the petitioners out of Federal court forever."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":8,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"That's pretty simple."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":8,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"The door is closed forever.

I think that's -- it's as simply as that. And -- and what the statute is designed to do, I -- I think you're telling us, is to say, look it, be careful.  Make all your claims in the State court the first time.  That doesn't seem to me to be too much to demand."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":7,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"But they're all --"},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":4,"spokeBefore":7,"sideBefore":"justices","text":"I take it -- I take it that  one of the answers to the observation that the Federal court is closed to a third of the claims is that that's not true with respect to the exhausted claims.  The -- the petition can simply be purged as to unexhausted claims and as to the exhausted claims, the courthouse door remains open."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":7,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"May I ask you --"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":7,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"-- with respect to this case? I thought this case was such a good illustration of the problem.  If claims came into the Federal court neatly labeled, exhausted, unexhausted, then I think that you would have a very strong argument.  But as this case illustrates, the question of whether it's been exhausted or not is something on which people can disagree.  And I suppose why the district court took well over a year to decide this case is the petitioner says, I've exhausted everything, and the prosecutor says, you have not exhausted 12.  And the district court is going by the -- going over these one by one and says in the end, you're both wrong.  My list is eight.  And it's that problem of has this claim been exhausted. Now, if it was a case of deliberately  withholding a case from State court and bringing it up fresh in -- in the Federal court, that would be a case where the Federal court should say, go away, you didn't even try.  But what do you do with these cases where it's really hard to tell whether the claim has been exhausted?"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":7,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Then why did the -- the district judge says four on the State's list have been exhausted?"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":7,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"So that -- that would take care of the four claims.

But what about the other four?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":3,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Even without going back to the State court, I don't see anything in this statute which indicates that Congress expected everybody who comes into Federal court with unexhausted claims to have time to remedy that defect by running back to State court and -- and filing.  This statute doesn't give any such indication. And it's clear that will never happen if he files on the 364th day after the conclusion of the State proceedings.  Right?  I mean, his year is up already. Even if the judge decides the question the next morning, it's too late. So I -- I don't know why we have to be concerned about giving him some entitled second chance to go back to -- to State court.

The -- but the -- the question that I would have is, is there anything the other way?  I mean, in Duncan, you know, I was dissenting and the thing that sort of moved me is I couldn't imagine Congress really cared about  this.  I mean, what they do is they want to have you file within a year.  And they say, well, but if you filed within a year and you're in State court, we don't care anymore.  You're being -- if you file in the wrong State court, you're tolled.  We don't really care once you're proceeding.  And now, however, if you go in -- into Federal court by mistake instead of State court by mistake, well, you're out of luck on a random basis.  Some judges will get you back in on time.  Other judges won't. Is there anything in the history or anywhere -- I -- I'm interested in the history from your point of view, as much as the other.

And you could check against repeatedly abusing this by saying, and you get  only one opportunity to do it."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":6,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"But Rose and Lundy also assumed that they could go back to State court and -- and in -- in fact this could be done without wiping out the claims. And the difference between the situation in Rose and Lundy and the situation we've got now is the difference which is focused, I think, in -- in Justice Ginsburg's four claims as to which there was disagreement even between the district court and -- and the State as to whether there was exhaustion.  There -- there isn't a -- a -- as a -- as a systemic matter across the United States, there simply isn't a way for most of these people to go back and litigate their State claims.

Lundy, and everybody agrees with the one, you must exhaust in State court.  You cannot have the Federal court take a first view of that question.  You -- you must exhaust.  And -- but then Rose v. Lundy also said without prejudice, and your reading strikes out without prejudice not based on the defendant's conduct, not based on the petitioner's conduct, but because it took the district court more than the limitation period just to sort out which claims were exhausted and which weren't."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":7,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Well, the -- the troublesome thing is some petitioners will be able to do just what you said in South Dakota, go back to the State court a second time, because they had a swift district judge, and some won't because the district judge was slow.  So to treat identically situated petitioners differently not because of any lapse on the petitioner's part but solely because one had the luck to get before a swift district judge and the other, the bad luck to get before a procrastinator, that seems arbitrary and not anything that Congress built into the statute."},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":7,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"No, did go.
