A firm that they are all paralegals, and they then bill the law firm at their own hourly rate, and then the law firm in turn bills the client.

Let's assume two cases: Case A, you hire an outside paralegal at $85 an hour. He is outside, he is independent. He is just like the expert engineer in the Chief Justice question, $85 an hour. Case two, it's your own paralegal. The prevailing rate for which you charge general clients is $85 an hour.

So I -- I would think that, well, EAJA is the more compensatory because it allows for more items."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Counsel, your - - this question only arises when the position of your client was not substantially justified. Now under those -- and it was designed, to some extent, to penalize you because -- because of that fact. Why should we adopt a construction that, in effect, penalizes the client who has had to face the Federal Government when the Federal Government's position was not substantially justified? They are going to have to pay the paralegal fees at market rates, but they are only goes to get compensation at cost."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"It's kind of a stretch to suggest in a situation where they pass a law that only applies to individuals or small businesses where they put a cap in and so on, that another way that we are going to prevent damage to the fisc was to treat paralegal expenses as costs rather than at market rate.

Under your system it would make sense for lawyers to charge separately for photocopy services, telephone services, so on because then they are not going to be subject to the attorney fee cap.
