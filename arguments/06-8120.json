I assumed that this officer was required to arrest the person, and we can have hypotheticals, he sees somebody wanted for multiple murders and so forth.

This was the search of a person incident to an arrest, and I really jumped a little bit ahead of the questions that Justice Alito was proposing.

And are you acknowledging that the arrest is legal, that whatever the exclusionary rule does, it does not require you -- when you've engaged in an unlawful seizure and you find an ax murderer sitting there in the car, you don't have to say sorry, I shouldn't have stopped the car. You can arrest the person, right?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":6,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"So the arrest is legal.

And if he was acting lawfully when he made the arrest, why doesn't he get the benefit of the plain view doctrine to the extent that he saw any evidence before him at that point? And I take it the plain view exception would at least cover the, I forget what it was, but the materials that were in the, in the passenger well of the passenger car, that -- that were known to be used as a source of, of ingredients for making methamphetamine?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"No, I realize. But we've got -- we've got a choice here, I mean, I think Justice Kennedy's questions brought this out. We've got a choice here of two ways to look at the State action at the moment of -- of the arrest. One way to look at it would be to say it was a product of an unlawful stop. Another way to look at it would be to say it was an act of executing a validly issued warrant. And you concede that they at least could lawfully have executed the arrest, they didn't have the arrest warrant but there was an arrest warrant issued for them and they could lawfully execute that warrant and arrest him at that point. Let's assume that those are our two choices. On choice number one the State, the police officer, is acting someplace where he shouldn't have been. On choice number two, the parole violator, your client, is in a place where he shouldn't have been because he should have been arrested and he should have been back behind bars at that point. If we have a choice between those two ways of looking at the case, why don't we for any purpose, give the casting vote to the lawfulness of the arrest, to the warrant which was issued by a neutral and detached magistrate at some point? And if we do that, then why isn't not only a search incident to an arrest, but the seizure of materials which were in plain view at the moment of that arrest, subject to a -- an admissibility rule?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Okay.

I remember Brown but I don't think there was anything in Brown comparable to the lawful authority to arrest independent of the stop. And -- and that's what makes this case unusual. And -- and if we emphasize the lawfulness of the arrest, quite independent of the circumstances of the stop, and we also bear in mind that the point of the exclusionary rule is -- is to deter police conduct, and you've got another priority here, the driver, who can invoke the exclusionary rule and deter police misconduct. I don't see where the interest would lie in, or where the justification would lie, in our saying we've got to put, as it were all the eggs in the basket of the unlawful stop, as opposed to the basket of the lawful arrest."},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":5,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Well, do we have an -- an argument that something was seized from the driver that should not have been seized from his person?"},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":5,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Well, but I mean, that's not before us."},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":5,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"We're talking about evidence seized from the defendant."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":7,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"The California Supreme Court as far as I could tell was thinking that it turns, if you stop somebody, you stop somebody, if you make him think he isn't free to go. So you seem to me to give a lot of cases where he would feel free to go, and you're saying still that that's a stop. Well, I mean, suppose the policeman comes along and he sees three people in a car and there is Jack the Ripper driving. So he says okay, I'm stopping the car. Now he says the other three people, I'm not interested in you; my pal and partner here is in a second squad car; he will take you wherever you want to go.

The same facts that Justice Breyer just gave you. It's creeping along at, you know, a foot a minute.

Then they wouldn't have been stopped; is that right?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":6,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"So you're putting all the eggs into the basket that the, the car came to a complete stop and therefore they have been seized. And what is crucial for the seizure is the elimination on motion on the part of the car."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":6,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Any elimination of motion in a vehicle in which you are the passenger constitutes, at the request of the authorities, constitutes a seizure?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":6,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"But not if you're still rolling a little bit, a foot a minute. (Laughter.)"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"It seems to me that you're, you're blending two tests together, and tell me if I'm wrong. One test is there is no question that if the police get control over people, those people are not free to go."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"And those are the motion cases. The most extreme example being the -- the roadblock. Hodari D, did they -- you know, they were trying to catch him but did they actually get to the point of a seizure for Fourth Amendment purposes? Then you got another category of cases in which there is no question that someone is stopped, that a police officer can exercise control, and that control if so exercised is certainly going to be seizure for Fourth Amendment purposes. But we don't know whether the officer really is exercising control, so we ask the question would a reasonable person in the position of the individual stopped have believed that he was free to go? Aren't those two quite distinct tests? The first test assumes the answer to the question in the second test. The second test assumes the answer to the first test, i.e., they're stopped, subject to control. Aren't they two independent tests?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Okay. So you were engaging in shorthand? You, you accept the analytical distinction but you say look, in the real world once you stop, we -- we know how the person would have felt?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"A reasonable person would have felt."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"No, but aren't -- you are saying, I thought by agreeing with you what you were saying was once the car is stopped, a reasonable person under those circumstances would not have felt free to leave."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Okay."},{"name":"JUSTICE ALITO","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"What if the officer went, before even approaching the car got on the loudspeaker and said: \"Driver remain in the car; passenger, you're free to go\"?"},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"But you would state he is still seized because the car is stopped."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Well, then you're -- you're blending the two tests together again."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"You have either got to accept their analytical distinction or not."},{"name":"JUSTICE ALITO","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"What's the difference between that situation where the police officer says on the loudspeaker passenger remain, driver you're free to go, and the example that the State has in their brief, in which a car is stopped and as a result of the way it's stopped on a narrow road, the other cars behind that car are for some other period of time prevented from going forward? What's the difference between those two situations?"},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":7,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"So what it says here, getting out their quote from it, is it says it does not occur whenever there is a governmentally caused termination in individual's freedom of movement, nor even where there is a governmentally caused and governmentally desired termination of an individual's freedom of movement. That only when there is a termination of freedom of movement through means intentionally applied. Now, the only way I can -- I mean I say the difference between desired is that they didn't want to stop him. They are not interested in stopping him. That's not our desire to stop him. Our desire is to stop the driver. So if you don't have the desire and if there is no real restriction of any significance, is there a stop? I mean I would say Brower, they cited on their side, for that language."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":7,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Well, the passenger, you also have to have two things. One they don't intentionally want to stop him. Two, he doesn't think his movement is restricted. Where both of those things are true, then no stop. That's why the people who, say, are on the railroad car and they stop the whole train, that the railroad says don't worry, not an inconvenience: We'll have another train for new 10 or 15 minutes; just get out, except for car one where there is Jack the Ripper -- you know, those other people are not stopped. Now that's their argument. What's your response?"},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Well, does that make a difference? Let's say, you know, the car drives through a red light and the police lights come on. The passenger surmises that it's because they ran a red light. So that's a different case? You would say it's not seized if he reasonably, objectively, reasonably assumes it's because of what the driver did."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"So then why are we pointing out that they didn't know? It makes no difference under your view of the case."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Well then, if all that matters is the physical stop, what do you do about the cases that were talked about earlier where the other cars have to stop because of the way -- that's a physical stop and yet our cases indicate you're not seized in those situations."},{"name":"JUSTICE ALITO","id":3,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Well, how do you explain the justification for stopping if there is the seizure, for stopping the innocent passenger because the driver has committed a traffic violation? If that's a seizure of the passenger, then it's a seizure without reasonable suspicion of probable cause, right?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":6,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"What about a shutdown of an airport? You know, there is word that somebody has been seen walking in with a bag of explosives or it looks like a bag of explosives, so they stop all planes on the tarmac, shut down all exits to the airport until they can ascertain what this bag is. Everybody in the airport and everybody in those planes has been seized for Fourth Amendment purposes?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":6,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Okay, just the people who were trying to leave the airport. They had just arrived and they were going to go out to catch a cab and go home. They have been seized."},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":6,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Well, it turns out that there wasn't a bag of explosives and that no reasonable person would have thought. This was a knitting bag and some foolish cop thought it was a bag of explosives. That would have made it unreasonable.

"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":6,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Even, even when the reason the driver is stopped is that a police officer whose car was alongside, he looks over there and he sees that it is some notorious felon who is in the back seat, and the only reason he stops the car is so arrest that felon?

I think you're being consistent. You have to say that. You have to say that."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":4,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Well, consistent with that answer, consistent with that answer, what we're concerned with in these cases is not, in cases like this, is not literally the moment of the stop, but the moment of the stop plus one. And in cases like this the -- I take it you concede the question is would the passenger, would a reasonable passenger in, in that situation feel free to leave. And in the absence of a hypothetical like Justice Alito's in which the loudspeaker says, all I want is the driver, passenger is free to go, and so on, absent something like that, what is the argument that the, that a reasonable person in the passenger seat would feel free to open the door and traipse off?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":4,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Have you ever been stopped?

Policemen don't like people jumping out of the car. They don't know why they're jumping out of the car. And I would certainly if I were a passenger not feel free to immediately open the door and start walking away, and if I did I would expect the policeman to tell me: Get back in the car.

Just the driver, the driver's pulled over, and then somebody comes walking down the sidewalk, the driver's friend, he opens the car door, takes the suitcase and starts walking away?

I think that's a quite surprising proposition. Now, we don't have empirical studies and so forth, but at some point the Court takes judicial notice and I think indications from the bench are we just don't think passengers, A, are or, B, should feel free to leave when there's a traffic stop. I just think you have no social or empirical documentation for that position."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":7,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"But I mean, the question - - so I want to know how to decide this case. I understand what your position is. But I think the normal instinct of everybody is not about boats, taxis, airports and all these other examples, but this case. And I, I would say if you want to go on instinct I wouldn't think of getting out of a car when I'm the passenger and the policeman has stopped. But maybe I'm wrong.

Very few passengers jump out of the car, but that may be because they're worried about being run over.

That is, the law points us to the direction of what would a person reasonably think in general in such circumstances, and we can look at five million cases, but we don't know. So what do we do if we don't know? I can follow my instinct. My instinct is he would feel he wasn't free because the red light's flashing. That's just one person's instinct. Or I could say, let's look for some studies. They could have asked people about this, and there are none. Or I could say, well, you're the State of California, you're the ones able to get the studies; you could tell some of those professors, you know, to stop thinking about whatever they're thinking about and go ask a few practical questions, but you didn't. What should I do? Hold that against you? Look for more studies? Follow my instinct?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SCALIA","id":6,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Maybe we can just pass until the studies are done?

What's the significance of the arrest warrant, or -- yes, I guess there was a warrant as I understand it, although it was not on the person of the officer who stopped the car. Is that correct?"},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":4,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Okay. What's the significance of that for the outcome of this case?"},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":5,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Well, maybe our questions took your colleague representing the Petitioner beyond the question presented. The question presented is only whether the passenger felt seized. If we agree with the Petitioner, do we send the case back?"},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":5,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Well, why, if we have serious doubts whether or not the evidence is suppressible? All we've been asked in the question is, is whether the passenger is detained."},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":5,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"While the questions indicate that even if the passenger is detained, who cares, it's a lawful arrest."},{"name":"JUSTICE BREYER","id":7,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Well, that question hasn't been argued here."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Well, but there's - - you know, our Brown case establishes a multifactor test for determining when the illegal seizure has been attenuated and the Court hasn't applied that, the California Supreme Court hasn't gone through that test in this case."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOUTER","id":4,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"But don't we have two problems if we go to that stage? The first one is we would be applying a test that was not applied by the court we're reviewing. And number two, correct me if I'm wrong, but the, the -- assuming you win, as it were, on the general point about the significance of the, of the arrest warrant, there are still going to be questions about the suppression of the evidence because there are going to be questions about whether the legality of the arrest on that theory suffices to justify the seizure of the evidence. You recall the colloquy I had with opposing counsel about the possibility of applying a plain view test here. Aren't those issues that should all be decided in the first instance in the State courts?"},{"name":"JUSTICE GINSBURG","id":8,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"But the question that's presented is kind of a standing question. It's who can complain when the police stop a car? You say the driver. The question that's been presented in this case is, can the passenger also complain, and that's the only thing that we're dealing with. So the -- the arrest warrant may pose a disqualification for this particular passenger, but that would be a second question. The question that is tendered to us and that was answered by the California Supreme Court is when the car is stopped by the police who can complain."},{"name":"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS","id":2,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"No seizure of a passenger or a driver?"},{"name":"JUSTICE ALITO","id":3,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"What is this period of time that we are talking about when Mr. Brendlin might or might not have felt that he was free to leave? As I understand the facts, the officer recognized him as one of the two Brendlin brothers immediately upon approaching the car. Isn't that right."},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":5,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Well, it may be that we would say because of the exclusionary rule dynamic, we have very little interest in applying the exclusionary rule to this but I'm not so sure that we should bend the concept of seizure and say that the passenger hasn't been seized. Perhaps we should be very liberal insofar as applying the exclusionary rule and in this case it seems to me there is lawful arrest which is intervening cause anyway. But I don't know that we should distort the law of seizure."},{"name":"JUSTICE STEVENS","id":9,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Suppose 10 or 20 years ago we had this case and we decided your way and decided passengers are not seized, and then subsequently we had the question of whether an officer could order a passenger out of the car. What would be held then? Would we have said we can't because he is not seized? Or would you say yes, he was seized. I meant if we decided in your case there is no seizure, would we then have later on, do you think said, notwithstanding the absence of a seizure the officer could order the person out of the car?"},{"name":"JUSTICE STEVENS","id":9,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"But in most situations where an officer meets a person, unless there is a crime scene or something like that, he can't order them to cross the street or go someplace else, can he? He can't issue any order to a citizen."},{"name":"JUSTICE STEVENS","id":9,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"But he can issue orders to passengers even though they are not seized."},{"name":"JUSTICE KENNEDY","id":5,"spokeBefore":1,"sideBefore":"respondent","text":"Yes, but in that case there was a blanket rule. The officer didn't have to have a specific reason. And that it seems to me indicates that that's because the person as a general rule knows that he or she is seized. If the officer had to give a specific reason requiring the person to stand outside as the dissent said, then you might have had a point.
