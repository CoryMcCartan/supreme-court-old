Vast amounts of music.  And now they then send it down, perhaps to a million people at a time, who want to all hear the same song. Now, what you said was, if I understood it, but explain it if it is, that there is a provision of the copyright law that says when that happens, it's subject to a compulsory license.  And if it's subject to a compulsory license, then, of course, people can get it and it's paid for by somebody.

Mr. Clement, you have three minutes ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS Just a few points in rebuttal: First, I just have to correct a fundamental Alderson Reporting Company difference.  Mr. Frederick says, as he did in his red brief, that if you only -- if you are a cable company and you only retransmit locally, you don't have to pay a royalty.  That is just wrong, as we point out in the reply brief.  There is a minimum royalty that every cable company pays whether or not they transmit distance signals.  So that is just wrong. Second, this is not a case, as Mr. Frederick would like to say, where the user pushes a button, and then after that point, Aereo is just a hapless bystander.  And if you want insight into what actually happens behind the scenes, to use the phrase the District Court used, look at pages 64A to 67A of the petition appendix.  Because Judge Nathan explains all of the things that Aereo does after the consumer presses the button and before it comes back to them on their home screen.  They are not just a passive bystander. Also, this whole notion of what is volitional.  Maybe in the reproduction concept, in context, just pushing a button and there is only one person who reproduces, but the concept of what is the requisite volitional conduct is answered by the Transmit Clause.  Congress specifically looked at this and said there are going to be lots of situations where the sender, usually the cable company or Aereo, sends a Alderson Reporting Company transmission to the user, and the sender of that transmission, if it allows a contemporaneous performance, unlike the record company, they are a transmitter."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":4,"spokeBefore":3,"sideBefore":"justices","text":"Mr. Waxman, tell me the consequences of our decision today."},{"name":"JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR","id":4,"spokeBefore":0,"sideBefore":"petitioner","text":"Do you put them out of business, or do they have to go and negotiate a license with every copyright holder?
